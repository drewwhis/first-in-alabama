Hello teams!

We hope your seasons are progressing well and that you're feeling ENERGIZED!

## Tennessee Valley Authority Service Area Grants

We have received an update regarding grants for teams in the Tennessee Valley Authority service area, and it is not the update we'd hoped to be sharing. The granting organization this year is Tennessee Valley Robotics, and their process to select teams has concluded. Instead of an application process, they selected teams from a list based on team addresses that fell within the TVA service area. The grants have already been awarded and are in team accounts.

**HOWEVER** it appears that email notifications did not go out, so you'll need to check your Dashboard to see if you were awarded one of the grants. To do so, you'll need to log into your [Dashboard](https://my.firstinspires.org/Dashboard/). Next, make sure you are on the **MY TEAMS** tab. For each team you want to check, click to expand that team's entry in your Dashboard. Then you will need to check the **Team Finances** section for that team, and you will click on the **Funds & Grants** link (see below).

On the Funds and Grants page, you will want to expand the **Grants and Contributed Funds** item in the list. As you can see, the grants appear from **TN Valley Robotics** and should be in the amount of \$250. It looks as though they were awarded on **August 16**.

We would like to apologize for any issues you might encounter - we were not apprised of the selection process in advance. We strongly encourage teams to explore additional funding opportunities via *FIRST*'s [Grant Locator Tool](https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/team-grants).



## Challenge Qualifier Preferencing

As mentioned last week, teams in *FIRST*<sup>&reg;</sup> LEGO<sup>&reg;</sup> League Challenge will each compete in one qualifying event. We will announce specific events later in the season, but we can announce when preferencing will happen. In our preferencing system, you will rank all of the qualifier options from most-preferred to least-preferred. We will then place teams **as space at events allows**. While our goal is to give every team their first choice, this is **usually not possible**, so we try to give teams as high of a preference as we can.

This year, preferencing will open on **October 17th** and close the week of **October 24th**. We plan to announce placements on **October 31**. Remember that our qualifying events are planned for January 14th, 21st, and 28th, so hope this gives teams time to make travel plans, if needed. If you miss the preferencing window, don't worry! Every team will have a spot **somewhere**, it just may not be one of your top choices. We will share more information as the window approaches. 


## Challenge Score Calculator

The Official Scoring Calculator provided by *FIRST* is live! You can access it on the [Remote Hub website](https://remotehub.firstinspires.org/scoresheet). As you go through your practices, make sure to use this to verify your points, as it is aligned with the calculator used at all of our official events!

One word of caution is that some school networks *may* block the website from actually calculating the score. This is because the calculator may send a request to a server (possibly in the EU) that actually runs the calculation - the calculation does not happen in the browser. This isn't an issue on a home network or cellular network, so you may have workarounds if you're unable to work with your building's IT department.


## *FIRST* Mentor Network

Many teams can always use more help from mentors, and *FIRST* offers a tool to help match your team with available mentors. You can learn how to sign your team up with the [*FIRST* Mentor Network](https://info.firstinspires.org/mentor-network) and start looking for mentors today! 

Mentors are available for all *FIRST* programs (including FLL Explore and Challenge), in a variety of areas (including mechanical engineering or programming), with options for availability (including in-person and remote).

Mentors are a foundational element of the *FIRST* experience. We don't expect that our teachers and coaches will *always* be able to do *everything*. Mentors help to balance the workload while providing industry insights and experience to help develop your team.

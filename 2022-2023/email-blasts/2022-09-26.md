Hello teams!

As a brief reminder, we do have office hours this week!


## I Am More Than

This week marks the launch of *FIRST*'s<sup>&reg;</sup> \#IAmMoreThan campaign. As a global robotics community preparing young people for the future, we want every kid to recognize their worth, abilities and love who they are. Through our suite of programs, students develop well-rounded life capabilities including, creative problem-solving, leadership, communication, and most importantly, self-confidence and a sense of belonging. Whether it be finding their people or finding their path, students gain the skills, courage, and resiliency to be More Than.

You can learn more about the campaign on the [More Than Robots site](https://info.firstinspires.org/morethanrobots) and share it with others. There you can find information and our TV spots.


## Career Connections

One resource at your disposal for the SUPERPOWERED<sup>SM</sup> season is our [Career Connections playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpaPRqT711tik1kY1iUJX6_PhRIYv8o4z). This series of videos from *FIRST* offers some insights from people in the fields related to this season's theme. They can be used to spark interest or start new paths of research.


## Six Bricks

Six Bricks is a hands-on tool for learning. Through fun and short activities with sets of LEGO<sup>&reg;</sup> DUPLO<sup>&reg;</sup> bricks in six bright colors, children can practice their memory, movement, creativity and more. You can adapt activities and of course make your own activities to match the children’s skills and interests.

These activities range from building academic skills in math and language arts to more social and emotional skills. They're a great tool for working on your Core Values, and they can be used with students of any age - even adults! Learn more about [Six Bricks](https://cms.learningthroughplay.com/media/jrfpg4tx/sixbricks_ok_print.pdf) and see how you can incorporate them into your Core Values (or maybe even your next Professional Development session)!

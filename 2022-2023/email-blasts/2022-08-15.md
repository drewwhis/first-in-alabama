Hello teams!

Thank you to everyone who joined us at the Alabama Kickoff event this weekend! For those unable to attend, we have recorded the stream [on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3FrWVdpDeHc).


## Event Dates

We are ready to share some tentative dates and timelines for the Explore and Challenge programs!

For Explore (Grades 2nd - 4th), we are planning for the Alabama Festival in Huntsville in late March or early April. We should have the date confirmed by the end of August.

For Challenge (Grades 4th - 8th), we are planning our qualifying events for January 14, January 21, and January 28. We are not sure how many qualifiers there will be or if we will use all three dates. We will have a better picture of the events once teams are registered and paid with *FIRST*<sup>&reg;</sup>. For our newcomers, every team in Alabama will attend **one** qualifier, and we will assign teams via a preference lottery later in the season. We are planning for the Alabama Championship on February 18 at Fort Payne High School. Twenty-four (24) teams will advance to the Alabama Championship from their qualifying events.

We plan to share more details about all of these great events as they become available.


## *FIRST* Senior Mentors

Many of you have talked to or emailed with *FIRST* Senior Mentor Jamie McClung and are familiar with the *FIRST* Senior Mentor program. The *FIRST* Senior Mentors (FSMs) are "highly skilled and talented technical and non-technical individuals, who focus on recruiting, supporting and expanding *FIRST* programs." They support the entire progression of programs (FLL, *FIRST* Tech Challenge, and *FIRST* Robotics Competition) through a variety of responsibilities, and you can learn more about their role from [*FIRST*](https://www.firstinspires.org/ways-to-help/volunteer/senior-mentors).

While Jamie continues focusing his efforts in North Alabama, we are excited to announce Emmy Bray is joining him as a *FIRST* Senior Mentor, focusing her efforts in Central Alabama. Emmy formerly served in the AmeriCorps VISTA program for *FIRST*. Both Emmy and Jamie will serve as resources for the entire state, not just their primary focus regions. You can reach Jamie at [jmcclung@firstinspires.org](mailto:jmcclung@firstinspires.org) and Emmy at [ebray@firstinspires.org](mailto:ebray@firstinspires.org).

For our friends in South Alabama, we will have some news for you in just a couple of weeks, so stay tuned!


## Session Slides

*FIRST* LEGO<sup>&reg;</sup> League teams and class packs gain access to the Engineering Notebook and Team Meeting Guide materials, both in print and via ThinkScape. *FIRST* also provides Session Slides to help guide you and your students through each session outlined in those documents.

Session slides are available on the [*FIRST* LEGO League season site](https://www.firstlegoleague.org/season) for all three divisions. In the Season Resources section, select your Division (Discover, Explore, or Challenge) and scroll down to find the "Session Slides" item.

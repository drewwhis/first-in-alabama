Hello teams!

We have made it through the qualifier season!

## Challenge Qualifiers and State Championship

Congratulations to all of our teams who competed in this past week's qualifier. You can find the results on our [Challenge Results page](https://github.com/drewwhis/first-in-alabama/blob/main/2022-2023/challenge-results.md) as well as a list of all teams participating in the state championship! We will host an office hours session geared primarily toward our championship teams on **Wednesday, February 8** from 5 PM to 6 PM. Participants can join [online](https://meet.google.com/mso-yhrn-brp) or via phone: +1 315-599-0319 (PIN: 174 515 123#).

As a reminder, the Alabama Championship will be held Saturday, February 18 at Fort Payne High School in Fort Payne, Alabama. If you do not have a team participating, we encourage you to sign up as a volunteer (in your *FIRST* Dashboard). The event is also free and open to the public for spectators.

At the Gigawatts Qualifier, we tested streaming capabilities, and we are now planning to stream the Alabama Championship LIVE on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlVf0EZ4qdI). We also have a [live leaderboard](https://eventhub.firstinspires.org/leaderboard/c353f0ef-a3de-4e12-874c-750e76b4cf7d/b3c5fae7-37c5-4d35-abce-c346261a5cfc) available for Robot Game matches.

Hello teams!

We know many schools are currently dealing with the Flu-RSV-COVID trifecta, so we hope you're all staying well! As a reminder, we have office hours this Tuesday!


## Challenge Qualifiers

As a reminder to our Challenge teams, qualifier assignments were sent to teams last week. If you missed the preferencing window and would like to sign up for a qualifier, please contact us ASAP as we have extremely limited space available. We had planned on sharing points-of-contact and payment information this week, but we will have to delay that information another week. You can expect that information **next week**.

To help teams prepare for their qualifiers, we will be hosting a webinar on **Wednesday, November 16** from 6 PM to 7 PM to discuss what to expect at a qualifier, and answer questions! The session will be recorded and posted on our YouTube channel for those unable to attend.

Speakers include:
- Taylor Whisenant, *FIRST*<sup>&reg;</sup> LEGO<sup>&reg;</sup> League Program Delivery Partner for Alabama
- Jamie McClung, *FIRST* Senior Mentor and Veteran *FIRST* LEGO League Challenge Coach
- Chris Bero, *FIRST* LEGO League Challenge Head Referee for Alabama
- Drew Whisenant, *FIRST* LEGO League Challenge Judge Advisor for Alabama

You can join the meeting using [this link](). If you won't be able to attend and have questions you think other teams could benefit from hearing, please send those in advance so we can answer them during the session.


## Explore Festivals

As a reminder, the *FIRST* LEGO League Explore Alabama Festival will be held Saturday, April 8, 2023 at the von Braun Center in Huntsville, AL. We will open registration for this event after the start of the New Year, so be on the lookout! If we have the opportunity for teams to attend the Explore World Festival in Houston, TX, we will also share information at that time.

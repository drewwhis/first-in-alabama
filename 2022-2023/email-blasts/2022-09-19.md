Hello teams!

## Event Dates

As we get a clearer picture of the number of registered *FIRST*<sup>&reg;</sup> LEGO<sup>&reg;</sup> League Challenge (Grades 4th - 8th) teams, we are closer to being able to announce our qualifying events (in advance of our preferencing in October). As a reminder, we are planning our qualifying events for January 14, January 21, and January 28, and we know that we will have at least one event on each of those dates. We hope to share more information later this month, but the sooner your team registers with *FIRST*, the better we can announce those events. Every team in Alabama will attend **one** qualifier, assigned via a preference lottery. The Alabama Championship will be held on February 18 at Fort Payne High School. Twenty-four (24) teams will advance to the Alabama Championship from their qualifying events.

For Explore (Grades 2nd - 4th), we are able to announce that the *FIRST* LEGO League Explore Alabama Festival will be held on Saturday, April 8 at the von Braun Center in Huntsville, AL. This event will coincide with the 2023 *FIRST* Robotics Competition Rocket City Regional. We will send registration information for this event after the start of the new year, so be on the lookout in January! 


## *FIRST* Core Values

The [*FIRST* Core Values](https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/fll/core-values) unite the divisions of *FIRST* LEGO League and all of the *FIRST* programs. In *FIRST* LEGO League in particular, they play a direct role in your team's performance, both in the [Challenge Rubric](https://firstinspiresst01.blob.core.windows.net/first-energize/fll-challenge/fll-challenge-superpowered-rubrics.pdf) and in the [Explore Reviewing Sheet](https://firstinspiresst01.blob.core.windows.net/first-energize/fll-explore/fll-explore-superpowered-reviewing-documents.pdf). While your team will never be scored on whether they can directly *name* the Core Values, judges and reviewers look for how well teams demonstrate them, both in their work with *FIRST* LEGO League and in their broader lives.

Spending time with your team to reflect on the Core Values regularly can improve your performance in this area, of course, but it will also serve to make your team stronger while helping to develop your students into better individuals. You can learn more about the Core Values and the mission of *FIRST* on our [Vision and Mission page](https://www.firstinspires.org/about/vision-and-mission).

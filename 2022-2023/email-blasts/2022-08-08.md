Hello teams!

With the *FIRST*<sup>&reg;</sup> LEGO<sup>&reg;</sup> League SUPERPOWERED<sup>SM</sup> season officially underway, you can expect email blasts weekly on Monday evening/Tuesday morning.

## Alabama Kickoff Event

**This** Saturday, August 13, 2022, we will be hosting an Alabama kickoff event from 9 AM to 12 NOON Central Daylight Time. The event will be held at the University of Alabama in Huntsville and will be hosted by the university's chapter of the Society of Women Engineers (SWE). The event will be in the Shelby Center (301 Sparkman Drive, Huntsville, AL 35899). Be aware that this is the address **of the whole university**, not the specific building. We have included a map (at the end of this message) for your convenience. 

We are planning to stream the event (with recording to follow). You can view the stream live or recorded [using this link](https://youtu.be/3FrWVdpDeHc). While we expect this event to be largely geared toward FLL Challenge, we welcome FLL Explore and Discover folks to join as well!

The agenda is:
- 9:00 - 9:30 AM Team Check-In (Lobby)
- 9:30 - 10:00 AM Season Launch Viewing (Room 107)
- 10:00 - 10:30 AM Energy Expert Panel (Room 107)
- 10:30 - 11:15 AM Judging and Robot Game Overviews (Room 107)
- 11:15 - 12:00 NOON Team Social Activities (Lobby)

Be aware that the streamed content should last between 9:30 AM and 11:15 AM, but if the overview run long we will continue the stream.


## Weekly Office Hours

Our office hours continue this week! While we expect most questions will come from our Challenge folks, these sessions are open to all three levels - Challenge, Explore, and Discover. We have not had any participation yet (understandably), so we will continue to offer these sessions through August and then reevaluate for the fall and into the winter.

The **current** plan is to offer sessions:
- Tuesdays from 3 PM to 4 PM
- Thursdays from 6 PM to 7 PM

All times are Central. The sessions will be hosted in Google Meet at https://meet.google.com/mso-yhrn-brp. If you prefer to dial in, you can call +1 315-599-0319 and enter the PIN 174 515 123#.

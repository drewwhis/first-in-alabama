Hello teams!

Don't forget that this is an office hours week - Thursday at 5 PM!

## Team Registration

Now that we're about a month into the SUPERPOWERED<sup>SM</sup> season, now is a good time to make sure your team is registered and paid with *FIRST*<sup>&reg;</sup>. Paying your registration fee is how you get access to materials (like the Engineering Notebook and Team Meeting Guide) and to the store front (for Challenge Sets or additional LEGO<sup>&reg;</sup> product). It's also how we know how many teams will be participating in our region.

You can check out through [your Dashboard](https://my.firstinspires.org/Dashboard/). The fee is \$250 for *FIRST* LEGO League Challenge teams and \$125 for *FIRST* LEGO League Explore teams. If your team should be tax-exempt, **make sure you upload your tax documents before you check out**. *FIRST* is unable to process tax refunds for orders placed before documentation is approved.

Please register your team as soon as possible. If you're still looking for funding, consider the [Grant Locator Tool](https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/team-grants).


## *FIRST* Senior Mentors

Many of you have talked to or emailed with our *FIRST* Senior Mentors Jamie McClung and Emmy Bray and are familiar with the *FIRST* Senior Mentor program. The *FIRST* Senior Mentors (FSMs) are "highly skilled and talented technical and non-technical individuals, who focus on recruiting, supporting and expanding *FIRST* programs." They support the entire progression of programs (FLL, *FIRST* Tech Challenge, and *FIRST* Robotics Competition) through a variety of responsibilities, and you can learn more about their role from [*FIRST*](https://www.firstinspires.org/ways-to-help/volunteer/senior-mentors).

We promised some news for our friends in South Alabama a few weeks ago. While Jamie continues to focus on North Alabama and Emmy on Central Alabama, we are excited to announce Vicki Smith is joining them as a *FIRST* Senior Mentor, focusing her efforts in South Alabama. Some of you may know Vicki from her work as the Regional Chair for the *FIRST* Robotics Competition Rocket City Regional. 
 
All three will serve as resources for the entire state, not just their primary focus regions. You can reach:

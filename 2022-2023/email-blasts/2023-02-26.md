Hello teams!

## Challenge Season Wrap-Up

Thank you to everyone who joined us for the *FIRST*<sup>&reg;</sup> LEGO<sup>&reg;</sup> League Challenge Alabama Championship for the SUPERPOWERED<sup>SM</sup> season! We have updated our [Event Results page](https://github.com/drewwhis/first-in-alabama/blob/main/2022-2023/challenge-results.md) to reflect all of the Robot Game scores and Awards recipients. The recording of the live stream is also available [on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlVf0EZ4qdI&t=13065s) (the Opening Ceremony starts around the 3:37:50 mark).

We hope you all have had a fun and memorable season and will continue to grow and learn between now and the next season launch, currently expected in early August!


## Explore Festival and Rocket City Regional

At this point, registration has closed for the *FIRST*<sup>&reg;</sup> LEGO<sup>&reg;</sup> League Explore Alabama Festival, and we are looking forward to welcoming around 20 teams to the event! This event will take place on Saturday, April 8, 2023, at the von Braun Center South Hall. This event will run as one of the activities during the *FIRST*<sup>&reg;</sup> Robotics Competition Rocket City Regional, which runs from Thursday, April 6 to Saturday, April 8 in the same location. 

Both events are free and open to the public for spectators, so all are welcome to attend! During Saturday's activities, we will also be showcasing some of Alabama's *FIRST*<sup>&reg;</sup> LEGO<sup>&reg;</sup> League Challenge teams and *FIRST*<sup>&reg;</sup> Tech Challenge teams, so the entire progression of *FIRST* programs will be on display.

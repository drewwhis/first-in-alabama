Hello teams!

We hope everyone is getting ready for the upcoming break!

## Final Office Hours of 2022

We will have the final office hours of 2022 **Wednesday**! We will host them from **5 PM to 6 PM** on **Wednesday, December 7**. As always, you can join [online](https://meet.google.com/mso-yhrn-brp) or via phone: +1 315-599-0319 (PIN: 174 515 123#).

We will host three office hours in January, one each week of the qualifier season, so be on the lookout for those dates!


## Youth Team Member Registration

All *FIRST*<sup>&reg;</sup> participants, including those in *FIRST* LEGO<sup>&reg;</sup> League, are required to be registered with their teams. This is also the primary method for students to have their Consent and Release Forms completed. In *FIRST* LEGO League Challenge, the age (9-14) or grade (4th-8th) requirements are enforced at the time the student **signs up** for the team. Students in *FIRST* LEGO League Explore must also be registered with their teams.

*FIRST* has created a page to help with this process called the [Youth Registration System Overview](https://www.firstinspires.org/resource-library/youth-registration-system), with a section specific to helping [Lead Coaches/Mentors](https://www.firstinspires.org/resource-library/youth-registration-system#LeadCoachMentor) with the process. As a Coach, you should use Option 1 (included at the end of this email) to invite the **parents**. The parents will then add their own children following the [Instructions for Parents/Guardians](https://www.firstinspires.org/resource-library/youth-registration-system#parents), which you can share with them.

If you run into any issues with the process or have questions, you can reach out to [*FIRST*](mailto:firstteammembers@firstinspires.org?subject=Youth%20Registration%20System).

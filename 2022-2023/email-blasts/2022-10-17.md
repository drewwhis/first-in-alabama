Hello teams!

This week is all about events - both for Challenge and Explore!

## Challenge Event Preferencing

We have contacted the Lead Coach/Mentor 1 for all teams that are secured with *FIRST*<sup>&reg;</sup> or still have a temporary team number. The preferencing period will end **next Friday**, October 28, and we will announce placements on the 31st.

If you do not see one (or more) of your teams in the form **or** if your team did not receive the form, please let us know so we can investigate! **Do not send your preferences in any way other than the form**. This is how we will be able to ensure every team is eligible with *FIRST*.


## Explore Event

As a reminder, the *FIRST* LEGO League Explore Alabama Festival will be held Saturday, April 8, 2023 at the von Braun Center in Huntsville, AL. We will open registration for this event after the start of the New Year, so be on the lookout!

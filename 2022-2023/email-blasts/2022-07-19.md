Hello teams!

It's hard to believe, but we are just two short weeks away from the launch of *FIRST*<sup>&reg;</sup> LEGO<sup>&reg;</sup> League SUPERPOWERED<sup>SM</sup>!

## Alabama Kickoff Event

On Tuesday, August 2, 2022, the SUPERPOWERED season will launch worldwide! Anticipate the launch video to drop at 12 NOON Eastern Daylight Time (11 AM CDT) on the [*FIRST* LEGO League YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuGaG4GtEj82i3pByi_bM3A).

On Saturday, August 13, 2022, we will be hosting an Alabama kickoff event from 9 AM to 12 NOON Central Daylight Time. The event will be held at the University of Alabama in Huntsville and will be hosted by the university's chapter of the Society of Women Engineers (SWE). The event will be in the Shelby Center (301 Sparkman Drive, Huntsville, AL 35899). We are currently looking at options to stream/record the event. While we expect this event to be largely geared toward FLL Challenge, we welcome FLL Explore and Discover folks to join as well!

The agenda is:
- 9:00 - 9:30 AM Team Check-In (Lobby)
- 9:30 - 10:00 AM Season Launch Viewing (Room 107)
- 10:00 - 10:30 AM Energy Expert Panel (Room 107)
- 10:30 - 11:15 AM Judging and Robot Game Overviews (Room 107)
- 11:15 - 12:00 NOON Team Social Activities (Lobby)

We have also included a map (at the end of this message) for your convenience.


## Weekly Office Hours

This season, we'll be launching office hours! These will be one-hour virtual sessions offered twice weekly where coaches can drop in and ask questions about any number of *FIRST* or *FIRST* LEGO League topics! The sessions will **not** be recorded, but we will make sure to share any noteworthy developments that come out of them. While we expect most questions will come from our Challenge folks, these sessions are open to all three levels - Challenge, Explore, and Discover!

The sessions will be hosted by Drew Whisenant, Alabama *FIRST* LEGO League Challenge Judge Advisor, and other key personnel will be invited (though their attendance isn't guaranteed), including:
- Taylor Whisenant, Alabama *FIRST* LEGO League Program Delivery Partner
- Jamie McClung, Alabama *FIRST* Senior Mentor
- Chris Bero, Alabama *FIRST* LEGO League Challenge Head Referee
- Others!

If a topic comes up that one of our key personnel would be more suited to answer, we'll make sure to direct it to them! The current plan is to offer sessions:
- Tuesdays from 3 PM to 4 PM
- Thursdays from 6 PM to 7 PM

Our first office hours session will be on **Thursday, July 28, 2022** during the 6 PM to 7 PM time slot. This will provide you with an opportunity to check in and ask questions before the season launch on **Tuesday, August 2, 2022**.


## *FIRST* in Alabama Discord Server

We have a Discord server for all *FIRST* teams in Alabama across the entire progression of programs. Membership is extended to coaches, mentors, parents, and students. As with any Internet account, members must be at least 13 years old to sign up for a Discord account.

Here, you can directly message with *FIRST* staff and field representatives, as well as with other coaches. We also tend to make big announcements and share links in the Discord prior to a regularly scheduled email.

To join the server, use [this link](https://discord.gg/XfurbWERQ8). Once you're in, you can view each program's channel (`frc`, `ftc`, `fll-discover`, `fll-explore`, `fll-challenge`), as well as the `volunteer` channel.

You can learn more about using Discord [here](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360045138571-Beginner-s-Guide-to-Discord).

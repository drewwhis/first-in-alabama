Hello teams!

With the end of October also comes qualifier assignments!

## Challenge Event Assignments

We have completed the process of assigning Challenge teams to their qualifiers. We have already sent teams their placements. If you completed preferencing and did not receive a message **check with the other leaders of your team**. If they do not have the information, then feel free to reach out.

If you missed the preferencing window, we still have some space at the Port City Qualifier in Mobile on January 21 and at the Gigawatts Qualifier in Fort Payne on January 28. All of our other events are currently at capacity. If you would like to sign up for a qualifier and missed the window, please contact us ASAP.

We will be sending more information about specific qualifier events, including points-of-contact and payment information, **next week**.


## Challenge Webinar

We will be hosting a webinar on **Wednesday, November 16** from 6 PM to 7 PM to discuss what to expect at a qualifier, and answer questions! The session will be recorded and posted on our YouTube channel for those unable to attend.

Speakers include:
- Taylor Whisenant, *FIRST*<sup>&reg;</sup> LEGO<sup>&reg;</sup> League Program Delivery Partner for Alabama
- Jamie McClung, *FIRST* Senior Mentor and Veteran *FIRST* LEGO League Challenge Coach
- Chris Bero, *FIRST* LEGO League Challenge Head Referee for Alabama
- Drew Whisenant, *FIRST* LEGO League Challenge Judge Advisor for Alabama

We will send attendance information in next week's email! If you won't be able to attend and have questions you think other teams could benefit from hearing, please send those in advance so we can answer them during the session.

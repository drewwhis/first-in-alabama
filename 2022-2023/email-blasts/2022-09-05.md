Hello teams!

Now that September is here, remember that office hours will be offered every other week - and this is the off week!

## Youth Team Member Registration

All *FIRST*<sup>&reg;</sup> participants, including those in *FIRST* LEGO<sup>&reg;</sup> League, are required to be registered with their teams. This is also the primary method for students to have their Consent and Release Forms completed. In *FIRST* LEGO League Challenge, the age (9-14) or grade (4th-8th) requirements are enforced at the time the student **signs up** for the team. Students in *FIRST* LEGO League Explore must also be registered with their teams.

*FIRST* has created a page to help with this process called the [Youth Registration System Overview](https://www.firstinspires.org/resource-library/youth-registration-system), with a section specific to helping [Lead Coaches/Mentors](https://www.firstinspires.org/resource-library/youth-registration-system#LeadCoachMentor) with the process. As a Coach, you should use Option 1 (included at the end of this email) to invite the **parents**. The parents will then add their own children following the [Instructions for Parents/Guardians](https://www.firstinspires.org/resource-library/youth-registration-system#parents), which you can share with them.

If you run into any issues with the process or have questions, you can reach out to [*FIRST*](mailto:firstteammembers@firstinspires.org?subject=Youth%20Registration%20System).


## *FIRST* LEGO League Challenge Important Documents

The [Robot Game Rulebook](https://firstinspiresst01.blob.core.windows.net/first-energize/fll-challenge/fll-challenge-superpowered-robot-game-rulebook.pdf) is important for understanding and preparing for the Robot Game as announced at season launch.

Equally important (or more) is the [Challenge Updates and Clarifications](https://firstinspiresst01.blob.core.windows.net/season/challenge-updates.pdf) document. Make sure to check this link weekly - there have already been some changes and clarifications. Most recently, there was a change to how the Wind Turbine model is constructed - it wasn't a big change, but it's a **significant** change, so pay close attention!

Finally, remember that your performance in the Robot Game is only one-fourth or **25%** of your evaluation at a competition - the remainder comes from judging! The [Rubrics](https://firstinspiresst01.blob.core.windows.net/first-energize/fll-challenge/fll-challenge-superpowered-connect-rubrics-2022-23-greyscale.pdf) for judging are available and are a great resource for your team to use when preparing for a competition or to plan their engineering and design processes, both in terms of Robot Design and the Innovation Project.

**For Lead Coach/Mentor to Invite Parents**:

1. Log in to your Dashboard at [www.firstinspires.org](https://www.firstinspires.org).
2. Click on the "**Invite Contacts**" link located in the "**Team Contacts/Roster**" column.
3. Click on the blue "**INVITE CONTACTS**" button.
4. Select "**Parent/Guardian**" as the contact type.
5. Enter the **PARENT**'s name and email address in the appropriate fields and click "**Add**."
6. Enter additional **parents** as needed; be sure to click "add another" after your last entry even if you are not adding another name.
7. Click "**Send Invitation**."

This will generate an email to the parent/guardian contact alerting them that they have been invited to sign the youth *FIRST* Consent and Release Form and to apply their youth to your team. If they do not already have a user profile, they will be asked to create a parent account and complete their youth’s profile from the "Parent/Guardian – Youth" tab. [For complete instructions for new and returning parents please refer to the Parents/Legal Guardian section of this page](https://www.firstinspires.org/resource-library/youth-registration-system#parents).

Once the student or parent has applied to the team, you will need to go back to the Team Contacts page to accept or decline the youth team members. To do so, scroll down to "**Application Pending**" under the youth members section, then click the "**Options**" menu on their contact card. You will then see the accepted team members on your printable roster.

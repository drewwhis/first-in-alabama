# *FIRST*<sup>&reg;</sup> Robotics Competition

## Annual Fees

In Alabama, our teams fall under the regional model (as compared to the district model). In this model, here are the fees (payable to *FIRST*<sup>&reg;</sup>) you can expect (as well as what each fee will get you). Of the fees listed below, only **Registration** is required of all teams. The others depend on your team's goals/successes for the given season.

- Registration (\$6000)
  - Registration with *FIRST*<sup>&reg;</sup> for the current season
  - Kit of Parts (or vouchers) for the current season (including *FIRST*<sup>&reg;</sup> Choice)
  - Product and software vouchers for the current season
  - Competition at one (1) Regional Event in the current season
- Additional Regional Event Registration (\$3000)
  - Competition at one (1) *additional* Regional Event in the current season
- *FIRST*<sup>&reg;</sup> Championship Registration (\$5750)
  - Competition at *FIRST* Championship in the current season

To learn more about the fees payable to *FIRST*, you can consult the [Cost & Registration Page](https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc/cost-and-registration). Again, teams in Alabama should pay attention to the fees for **Regional Event Participants**.


## Grants

For most *FIRST* teams, only **Restricted** grants are available through the *FIRST* Dashboard. These grants can be used on anything that you purchase in the Dashboard. At the end of the season, any remaining funds will be removed from the team account (and redistributed or returned subject to the terms of the granting organization).

For US-based FRC teams (including teams in Alabama!), **Unrestricted** grants are also available. These funds work the same as Restricted grants, except teams have the ability to receive these funds directly through the *FIRST* re-granting process. To learn more about the re-granting process, refer to [*FIRST*'s guidelines](https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/regranting-process-procedures-and-w-9).


## Kit of Parts

Your initial registration fee with FRC includes both your first event registration as well as the Kit of Parts. This kit includes many physical, digital, and financial components, some of which you can opt-out of. To learn about everything in the kit, refer to the [Kit of Parts page](https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc/kit-of-parts).

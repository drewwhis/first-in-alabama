## Annual Fees

In Alabama, our teams fall under the regional model (as compared to the district model). In this model, here are the fees (payable to *FIRST*<sup>&reg;</sup>) you can expect (as well as what each fee will get you). Of the fees listed below, only **Registration** is required of all teams. The others depend on your team's goals/successes for the given season.

- Registration (\$6000)
  - Registration with *FIRST*<sup>&reg;</sup> for the current season
  - Kit of Parts (or vouchers) for the current season (including *FIRST*<sup>&reg;</sup> Choice)
  - Product and software vouchers for the current season
  - Competition at one (1) Regional Event in the current season
- Additional Regional Event Registration (\$3000)
  - Competition at one (1) *additional* Regional Event in the current season
- *FIRST*<sup>&reg;</sup> Championship Registration (\$5750)
  - Competition at *FIRST* Championship in the current season

To learn more about the fees payable to *FIRST*, you can consult the [Cost & Registration Page](https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc/cost-and-registration). Again, teams in Alabama should pay attention to the fees for **Regional Event Participants**.

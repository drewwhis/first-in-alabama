Hello teams!

## Event Preferencing Round 1

Round 1 of Event Preferencing is quickly approaching! The preference window will open on Thursday, September 26 at 11 AM Central Time and will close on Thursday, October 3 at 11 AM Central Time. You can learn more about the Event Preferencing System from *FIRST*'s [web page](https://www.firstinspires.org/resource-library/frc/event-preference-system). You can also refer to the [User Guide](https://www.firstinspires.org/sites/default/files/uploads/resource_library/frc/registration/event-preference-system-user-guide.pdf) and their [FAQ](https://www.firstinspires.org/sites/default/files/uploads/resource_library/frc/registration/event-preferencing-faq.pdf).

As a reminder, the *FIRST*<sup>&reg;</sup> Robotics Competition Rocket City Regional will be held March 12-15, 2025 at the von Braun Center in Huntsville, Alabama! This makes the event a **Week 3** event in the FRC Calendar.

Those of you whose teams are deemed *Event Ready* **may** have received an email from *FIRST* HQ recently confirming your ability to participate in Event Preferencing (if you are subscribed to the emails). If you're not sure, check the information below or reach out to [*FIRST* Customer Service](mailto:customerservice@firstinspires.org) to confirm your status.

For those new to FRC, this is the process you will need to follow to make registering for your first event as smooth as possible. There are a few things you will want to have complete **BEFORE** the lottery opens:
- Make sure you have a Lead Coach/Mentor **1** in the *FIRST* Dashboard who has completed the YPP Screening (and agreed to all policies)
- Make sure you have a Lead Coach/Mentor **2** in the *FIRST* Dashboard who has completed the YPP Screening (and agreed to all policies)

NOTE: You must have **both** Lead Coach/Mentor 1 and Lead Coach/Mentor 2 - a Team Admin is **NOT** sufficient. Additionally, payment of registration is **NOT** required to participate in the preference lottery.

For the best experience, **do not change** your team contacts until **after** you have been assigned to an event. If you enter the lottery in compliance (both coaches screened) but one coach leaves the team before the lottery completes, your team may not be assigned an event. So make sure you have both coaches in **before** the lottery and make sure you don't change them until **after** the lottery (if something happens that week).


## Black Tote and Drive Base Opt-Out Deadline

There are many, many components to the [Kit of Parts](https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc/kit-of-parts) that you receive when registering as a team in the *FIRST*<sup>&reg;</sup> Robotics Competition. If you are a **veteran team** (one that has participated prior to the upcoming 2025 season), you have the option to opt out of some components, should you choose.

The Drive Base is a basic chassis, including wheels, belts, and gearboxes. In the past, this is typically a flavor of the [AM14U from AndyMark](https://www.andymark.com/products/am14u5-6-wheel-drop-center-robot-drive-base-first-kit-of-parts-chassis?via=Z2lkOi8vYW5keW1hcmsvV29ya2FyZWE6OkNhdGFsb2c6OkNhdGVnb3J5LzViYjYzNDM5YmM2ZjZkNmRlOGU2YWNhNg). Veteran teams may opt out of this element of the Kit of Parts and instead receive a \$450 voucher to AndyMark.

The Black Tote is an assortment of parts that can be used to help you build a robot, including the Kit Bot. You can learn more about what was in the 2024 Black Tote by referring to [last season's checklist](https://firstfrc.blob.core.windows.net/frc2024/KOP/2024KOPChecklist-BlackTote.pdf). There are changes expected to the contents of the Black Tote this season (see [this blog post](https://community.firstinspires.org/looking-back-on-the-2024-kitbot-moving-forward) as well as [this blog post](https://community.firstinspires.org/kitbot-kit-opt-outs)), so don't make your decision based solely on past-season contents. Veteran teams may opt out of this element of the Kit of Parts and instead receive a \$125 voucher to AndyMark **as well as** a \$125 voucher to REV Robotics.

If your **veteran** team wishes to exercise either or both of these opt-out options, the deadline is Tuesday, September 24. You can learn more about the opt-out process from [this page on the FRC Calendar](https://www.firstinspires.org/kit-opt-out-closes). Reminder: rookie teams (those who have **not** participated prior to the 2025 season) are not eligible to opt out of components of the Kit of Parts.


## Alliance Selection Updates

Several task forces have been meeting since the end of the 2024 season to discuss various topics relating to the FRC Experience with the goal of making improvements for participants, event hosts, volunteers, and headquarters. One of these task forces was charged with improving the Alliance Selection process at events.

There is a brief summary available in [this FRC Blog post](https://community.firstinspires.org/alliance-selection-task-force-update) as well as a more detailed explanation in the [changes explanation document](https://www.firstinspires.org/sites/default/files/uploads/resource_library/frc/game-and-season-info/competition-manual/alliance-selection-changes.pdf).

Both veteran and rookie teams should familiarize themselves with these changes, but they are **not yet final**. These changes are being piloted at an off-season event in October, so additional changes *may* be made prior to kickoff. Expect final details no later than the kickoff release of the manual for this season.

Hello teams!

Welcome to the 2024-2025 season [*FIRST*<sup>&reg;</sup> DIVE<sup>SM</sup> presented by Qualcomm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zM1wAo4eQzQ) and *FIRST*<sup>&reg;</sup> Robotics Competition REEFSCAPE<sup>SM</sup>.

Apologies in advances for the length of this message - future communications won't have as much to cover!

Also, **we are not able to announce the dates for the Rocket City Regional just yet**. We will share that information as soon as we have it available.

## STEM Night at Toyota Field (29 August)

We have an opportunity to share with local *FIRST* teams from the Rocket City Trash Pandas. Please see the message below and email Joanna Berry ([tickets@trashpandasbaseball.com](mailto:tickets@trashpandasbaseball.com)) if your team is interested in participating.

    This exciting event [STEM Night] is dedicated to celebrating Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics within the Huntsville community during our baseball game against the Tennessee Smokies. We are planning an evening filled with engaging activities, and opportunities for local organizations and clubs to showcase their contributions to the STEM fields, while also enjoying an action-packed baseball game! This event aims to inspire young minds, foster a love for STEM subjects, highlight the incredible innovations and educational opportunities available in our community, and give youth clubs the opportunity to publicly showcase some of their cool projects! We would be thrilled to have your club involved in this terrific night. Your participation could include hosting a table on the concourse, providing small demonstrations in the outfield kids zone area and/or on the field, or any other interactive activity that showcases your work in STEM, while also bringing a group out for the game. This is a fantastic opportunity to connect with the community, inspire the next generation of STEM enthusiasts, and attract new members to join your team!

## Awards Survey

The *FIRST* Robotics Competition awards working group is evaluating *FIRST* award hardware for the awards that that teams receive. As the recipients of our awards, weâ€™d appreciate your feedback through this [confidential, voluntary survey](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/AwardHardware) by Friday, August 16, 2024. 

We ask that only **one adult mentor per team** complete the survey. Please keep this survey confidential and do not post, share, or discuss this survey on social media, websites, etc. Any changes to hardware would be implemented for the **2026 season or beyond**. No changes are planned for the 2025 season. 

Thank you for your time. Your feedback is important to us.

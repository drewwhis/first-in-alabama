Hello teams!

We have some additional information to share with you regarding some upcoming deadlines!

## Event Preferencing Round 1

Round 1 of Event Preferencing is quickly approaching! The preference window will open on Thursday, September 26 at 11 AM Central Time and will close on Thursday, October 3 at 11 AM Central Time. You can learn more about the Event Preferencing System from *FIRST*'s [web page](https://www.firstinspires.org/resource-library/frc/event-preference-system). You can also refer to the [User Guide](https://www.firstinspires.org/sites/default/files/uploads/resource_library/frc/registration/event-preference-system-user-guide.pdf) and their [FAQ](https://www.firstinspires.org/sites/default/files/uploads/resource_library/frc/registration/event-preferencing-faq.pdf).

For those new to FRC, this is the process you will need to follow to make registering for your first event as smooth as possible. There are a few things you will want to have complete **BEFORE** the lottery opens:
- Make sure you have a Lead Coach/Mentor **1** in the *FIRST* Dashboard who has completed the YPP Screening (and agreed to all policies)
- Make sure you have a Lead Coach/Mentor **2** in the *FIRST* Dashboard who has completed the YPP Screening (and agreed to all policies)

NOTE: You must have **both** Lead Coach/Mentor 1 and Lead Coach/Mentor 2 - a Team Admin is **NOT** sufficient. Additionally, payment of registration is **NOT** required to participate in the preference lottery.

For the best experience, **do not change** your team contacts until **after** you have been assigned to an event. If you enter the lottery in compliance (both coaches screened) but one coach leaves the team before the lottery completes, your team may not be assigned an event. So make sure you have both coaches in **before** the lottery and make sure you don't change them until **after** the lottery (if something happens that week).

Finally, we are excited to share that the *FIRST*<sup>&reg;</sup> Robotics Competition Rocket City Regional will be held March 12-15, 2025 at the von Braun Center in Huntsville, Alabama! This makes the event a **Week 3** event in the FRC Calendar.

## STEM Night at Toyota Field (29 August)

We have an opportunity to share with local *FIRST* teams from the Rocket City Trash Pandas. Please see the message below and email Joanna Berry ([tickets@trashpandasbaseball.com](mailto:tickets@trashpandasbaseball.com)) if your team is interested in participating.

    This exciting event [STEM Night] is dedicated to celebrating Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics within the Huntsville community during our baseball game against the Tennessee Smokies. We are planning an evening filled with engaging activities, and opportunities for local organizations and clubs to showcase their contributions to the STEM fields, while also enjoying an action-packed baseball game! This event aims to inspire young minds, foster a love for STEM subjects, highlight the incredible innovations and educational opportunities available in our community, and give youth clubs the opportunity to publicly showcase some of their cool projects! We would be thrilled to have your club involved in this terrific night. Your participation could include hosting a table on the concourse, providing small demonstrations in the outfield kids zone area and/or on the field, or any other interactive activity that showcases your work in STEM, while also bringing a group out for the game. This is a fantastic opportunity to connect with the community, inspire the next generation of STEM enthusiasts, and attract new members to join your team!

Hello teams!

## Event Preferencing Round 1

Round 1 of Event Preferencing is underway - the window will close on Thursday, October 3 at 11 AM Central Time! 

You can learn more about the Event Preferencing System from *FIRST*'s [web page](https://www.firstinspires.org/resource-library/frc/event-preference-system). You can also refer to the [User Guide](https://www.firstinspires.org/sites/default/files/uploads/resource_library/frc/registration/event-preference-system-user-guide.pdf) and their [FAQ](https://www.firstinspires.org/sites/default/files/uploads/resource_library/frc/registration/event-preferencing-faq.pdf). If you find you are **unable** to submit preferences for your team, please review the User Guide and FAQ or reach out to [*FIRST* Customer Service](mailto:customerservice@firstinspires.org).


## Kickoff Registration

Kickoff Registration is now open! Teams may elect to have their Kit of Parts shipped directly to them (for a fee between \$30 and \$295, depending on kit contents) or they may select a local kickoff event **for no added fee**.

*FIRST*<sup>&reg;</sup> in Alabama will be supporting a local kickoff event again this year at the University of Alabama in Huntsville on Saturday, January 4. Teams may register to attend and have their kit delivered directly to the event! If your team **does not** wish to attend the event, you are still eligible to have your kit delivered for free - just send a team representative or surrogate to pick up your kit at the event! You can learn more about our local kickoff event by visiting the [event's information page](https://www.firstinspires.org/team-event-search/event?id=73447).

To sign up for the event and receive your kit (or to have your kit shipped directly to you), follow the instructions on the [Kit and Kickoff Registration page](https://www.firstinspires.org/kit-kickoff-registration-opens). If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out!


## Game Piece 2 Pre-Orders

For those who missed the [blog post](https://community.firstinspires.org/pre-orders-for-2025-game-pieces), FRC has announced there will be *two* game pieces in the 2025 REEFSCAPE presented by Haas game. Game Piece 1 has been described as something that can acquired easily locally, but Game Piece 2 will be something specific to the FRC game.

Because of the special nature of Game Piece 2 (and the limited supplies of notes during the CRESCENDO presented by Haas season), AndyMark will be offering *pre-orders* for Game Piece 2. You can pre-order Game Piece 2 by visiting [their pre-order page](https://www.andymark.com/products/frc-2024). Note that teams will receive two Game Piece 2 elements *for free* in their Kit of Parts.

Please refer to the [blog post](https://community.firstinspires.org/pre-orders-for-2025-game-pieces) for all available information before deciding whether to pre-order Game Piece 2 for your team. Game pieces ordered prior to November 1, 2024, are guaranteed to ship the week following Kickoff.


## Regional Advancement Changes

During the 2025 season, FRC will begin a phased implementation for changing how teams advance from Regional events to the *FIRST* Championship. [This blog post](https://community.firstinspires.org/regional-advancement-task-force-update) summarizes the changes from the Regional Advancement Task Force, and [this document](https://www.firstinspires.org/sites/default/files/uploads/resource_library/frc/game-and-season-info/2026-Regional-Advancement-Changes-Overview.pdf) outlines the full implementation that will be in place during the 2026 season.

Please read the blog post and overview document for full information, but a brief summary of the process for the 2025 season (REEFSCAPE) is:
- Winning Alliance Captain, Winning Alliance 1st Pick, *FIRST* Impact Award Winner, Engineering Inspiration Award Winner **will** advance.
- Wild Cards will **no longer be issued**. Previously, a team winning multiple advancement spots would generate one or more Wild Cards.
- The Priority Waitlist will **no longer exist**. Previously, some teams were placed on this special waitlist based on their event performance.
- The Open Waitlist will **no longer exist**. Previously, veteran teams could sign up to fill open spots at will.
- A Regional Advancement Points Model will be implemented to fill spots that are now opened up from removing Wild Cards, the Priority Waitlist, and the Open Waitlist

The [overview document](https://www.firstinspires.org/sites/default/files/uploads/resource_library/frc/game-and-season-info/2026-Regional-Advancement-Changes-Overview.pdf) goes into depth on how points will be awarded at events and how teams will advance to *FIRST* Championship *after* the event from the Regional Pool. You can also refer to the [CRESCENDO Game Manual](https://firstfrc.blob.core.windows.net/frc2024/Manual/2024GameManual.pdf) to learn more about the District Points Model (on which the Regional Advancement Points Model is heavily based).

There are *more* changes coming in the 2026 season, but most of the changes will be in place for the 2025 season. If you have any questions, feel free to reach out!

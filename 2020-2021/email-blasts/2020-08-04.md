Hello Coaches and Mentors!

Today marks the start of the seasons for *FIRST*® LEGO® League Challenge (4th - 8th Grade) and Explore (2nd - 4th Grade)!

The best thing you can do **right now** is make sure your team contacts are updated in the Dashboard, including leaving any teams you are no longer affiliated with! We have details in our [FAQ](https://github.com/drewwhis/alabama-first-lego-league/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions).

Don't forget you can always catch up if you missed an email by visiting our [Past Emails page](https://github.com/drewwhis/alabama-first-lego-league/tree/master/2020-2021/email-blasts).

# *FIRST*® LEGO® League Challenge Kickoff

Welcome to the 2020-2021 season, RePLAY! You can view the [kickoff video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxpXg5J5WdY), but make sure to [see all materials](https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/fll/challenge-and-season-info) so that you and your students understand all components and rules!

The participation rules are unchanged for this season. Each team must have two coaches (aged 18 or older) and two to ten students (aged 9 to 14 as of January 1, 2020). A team **may not have more than ten students total**. This includes part-time students, students who joined early and left, and students who joined late. Coaches may coach multiple teams, but each team must be registered separately with *FIRST*®.

There is a new judging and awards process for this season. We have compiled a few documents - make sure to check them out!

- [Judging](https://github.com/drewwhis/alabama-first-lego-league/tree/master/2020-2021/challenge/judging.md)
- [Rubrics](https://firstinspiresst01.blob.core.windows.net/first-game-changers/fll-challenge/Rubrics.pdf)
- [Advancement and Awards](https://github.com/drewwhis/alabama-first-lego-league/tree/master/2020-2021/challenge/advancement-and-awards.md)
- [Award Descriptions](https://github.com/drewwhis/alabama-first-lego-league/tree/master/2020-2021/challenge/award-descriptions.md)

For FLL Challenge, there are two fees due to *FIRST*®. There is a \$225 fee that registers you as an official team and allows you to order materials and apply to official events. There is a \$75 fee that will provide you with the mat and elements of the playing field. If you have multiple teams, you only need one mat and elements set, though you may purchase up to the number of teams you have (so they can share or have their own). **You will need at least one field kit to participate in virtual events.**

For any events you compete in (virtual qualifiers or the virtual state championship) you can expect the event fees to be **\$20 or less per team per event**.


# *FIRST*® LEGO® League Explore Kickoff

Welcome to the 2020-2021 season, PLAYMAKERS! You can view the [kickoff video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bR7YiR4ZPZc), but make sure to [read all materials](https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/fll/explore/challenge-and-season) so that you and your students understand all components and rules!

The participation rules are unchanged for this season. Each team must have two coaches (aged 18 or older) and two to six students (aged 6 to 10 as of January 1, 2020). A team **may not have more than six students total**. This includes part-time students, students who joined early and left, and students who joined late. Coaches may coach multiple teams, but each team must be registered separately with *FIRST*®.

For FLL Explore, there is one fee due to *FIRST*®, which is a \$99 fee that registers you as an official team and allows you to order materials, apply to official events, and receive your Explore Set.

We do not anticipate any event fees for the Explore division this season.


# *FIRST*® LEGO® League Discover and Class Pack

Class Pack is *FIRST*®'s **standards-aligned**, non-event programming. These include classroom offerings for FLL Challenge, FLL Explore, and FLL Discover, as well as for *FIRST*® Tech Challenge (FTC). Class Pack offerings **do not** include event participation or official team registration, though you can complement a Class Pack purchase with a team registration! 

For example, you could purchase Class Pack for FLL Challenge and form multiple "teams" within your classroom. You could purchase one (or more) FLL Challenge team registration and designate one (or more) of your classroom teams as event teams. This model would apply to FLL Challenge, FLL Explore, or FTC.

Class Pack purchases include all elements for up to 30 students **except robot and core kits**. The robot and and core kits are one-time purchases, reusable year-to-year. The Class Pack purchase is an annual purchase that provides materials aligned with the corresponding *FIRST*® program or division each year. FLL Explore also provides the School Pack option that serves up to 144 students.

*FIRST*® LEGO® League Discover is available **only** via Class Pack, and is a great STEM offering for any early childhood program.

For more information on Class Pack, visit [the Class Pack website](https://info.firstinspires.org/class-pack). We're happy to answer any questions we can, especially in regards to complementing Class Pack purchases and official teams with one another.


# Discord

Our Discord is available to coaches, mentors, parents, volunteers, and students (aged 13 and older) across all *FIRST*® programs! We have opted to move to Discord (across all programs) because it is very similar to Slack with the benefit that many students (especially high school students) are using it already! Like Slack, it can also be used to communicate with other coaches or with *FIRST*® staff. To learn more about using Discord, you can check out their [Beginner's Guide](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360045138571).

There is **no requirement or expectation** that you or anyone with your team use the Discord. We are simplify offering it as another avenue for members of our community to receive direct information.
 
To join the Discord as a member of the *FIRST*® LEGO® League program, you can use and share this link - Join Discord (disabled on GitHub).
 
If you are involved in multiple programs, you can add the other programs after you've joined! If you have questions, feel free to reach out.

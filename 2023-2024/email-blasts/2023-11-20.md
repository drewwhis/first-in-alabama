Hello teams!

We have finally wrapped the Challenge Qualifiers for the MASTERPIECE season!

## Challenge Results and Alabama Championship

After three weeks and four qualifiers, the field is set for the Alabama Championship! We would like to congratulate all teams who participated in an event this season, and we are excited to see twenty-four of you at the Alabama Championship on January 27, 2024, at Hampton Cove Middle School!

We have posted the qualifier results and the list of teams currently expected at the Alabama Championship on our [Challenge Results page](https://github.com/drewwhis/alabama-first-lego-league/blob/main/2023-2024/challenge-results.md). This list may change over time, as registration is currently underway with a deadline of **December 1, 2023**. If any team is unable to attend, we will invite additional teams from the Wild Card Pool.

If your team is not participating in the Alabama Championship, we encourage you to consider attending as spectators (all *FIRST*<sup>&reg;</sup> events are free and open to the public) or as volunteers ([learn how!](https://github.com/drewwhis/alabama-first-lego-league/wiki/Becoming-an-Event-Volunteer)).

We will likely have only one more office hours session before the end of year - on November 29. This session will be hosted in Google Meet at https://meet.google.com/mso-yhrn-brp. If you prefer to dial in, you can call +1 315-599-0319 and enter the PIN 174 515 123#. Feel free to come with questions or just listen in!


## Explore Festival

We will be opening registration for the Alabama Festival for our *FIRST*<sup>&reg;</sup> LEGO<sup>&reg;</sup> League Explore teams after the first of the year, so be on the lookout for that if you coach an Explore team! Teams must be registered and paid with *FIRST* in order to participate in the Alabama Festival, so make sure you are up-to-date in your *FIRST* Dashboard.

The event will be held on Saturday, April 6, 2024, at the von Braun Center in Huntsville, AL, as part of the *FIRST*<sup>&reg;</sup> Robotics Competition Rocket City Regional event.

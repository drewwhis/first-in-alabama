Hello teams!

We know many of you have already begun or are currently in the process of starting back to school, and we hope it's going well for you!


## Weekly Office Hours

We will continue office hours this season! Office hours are an opportunity for coaches to call in with questions about anything relating to *FIRST*<sup>&reg;</sup> or *FIRST* LEGO League. While we expect most questions will come from our Challenge folks, these sessions are open to all three levels - Challenge, Explore, and Discover! The first office hours window is tomorrow, August 8.

The current plan is to offer sessions on **Tuesdays** from 4:30 PM to 5:30 PM. All times are Central. The sessions will be hosted in Google Meet at https://meet.google.com/mso-yhrn-brp. If you prefer to dial in, you can call +1 315-599-0319 and enter the PIN 174 515 123#.

## *FIRST* in Alabama Discord Server

We have a Discord server for all *FIRST* teams in Alabama across the entire progression of programs. Membership is extended to coaches, mentors, parents, and students. As with any Internet account, members must be at least 13 years old to sign up for a Discord account.

Here, you can directly message with *FIRST* staff and field representatives, as well as with other coaches. We also tend to make big announcements and share links in the Discord prior to a regularly scheduled email.

To join the server, use [this link](https://discord.gg/XfurbWERQ8). Once you're in, you can view each program's channel (`frc`, `ftc`, `fll-discover`, `fll-explore`, `fll-challenge`), as well as the `volunteer` channel.

You can learn more about using Discord [here](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360045138571-Beginner-s-Guide-to-Discord).

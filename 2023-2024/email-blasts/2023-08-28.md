Hello teams!

Thank you to everyone who was able to join us for this past weekend's kickoff event! We will share the link to the recording as soon as it is available.

## Event Dates - Challenge and Explore

As mentioned at the kickoff event, have some fixed and tentative event dates to share.

Every Challenge team will participate in one Qualifier event. We will lottery preferences for qualifiers in September. We do not have *locations* to share just yet, but we plan to host qualifiers on these dates:
- Saturday, November 4
- Saturday, November 11
- Saturday, November 18

We will be able to finalize our list of qualifiers as more teams complete their registration for the current season in the [*FIRST*<sup>&reg;</sup> Dashboard](https://my.firstinspires.org/Dashboard/).

In addition, some Challenge teams will advance from their qualifiers to the Alabama Championship! The Alabama Championship will be held on Saturday, January 27, 2024, at Hampton Cove Middle School, in Owens Cross Roads, AL. 

Finally, all Explore teams will be invited to the Alabama Festival on Saturday, April 6, 2024, at the von Braun Center in Huntsville, AL. This event takes place as part of the *FIRST*<sup>&reg;</sup> Robotics Competition Rocket City Regional Event. We will send out registration information for this event after the start of the year.


## SPIKE Prime - Competition Ready Unit

For our Challenge teams, if you're not aware already, the Competition Ready Unit Plan has been updated in the SPIKE apps. This includes several lessons to help get started with robot building, including a lesson on the Guided Mission for the current season.

As of this writing, the current unit plan appears available in the current SPIKE App (Version 3) but not in the legacy version (Version 2). It's unclear whether the legacy version will receive the update. 

You can also find the lesson plan and curriculum for the unit on [LEGO's website](https://education.lego.com/en-us/lessons/prime-competition-ready/).


## Weekly Office Hours

We will continue office hours this season! Office hours are an opportunity for coaches to call in with questions about anything relating to *FIRST*<sup>&reg;</sup> or *FIRST* LEGO League. While we expect most questions will come from our Challenge folks, these sessions are open to all three levels - Challenge, Explore, and Discover!

The current plan is to offer sessions on **Tuesdays** from 4:30 PM to 5:30 PM. All times are Central. The sessions will be hosted in Google Meet at https://meet.google.com/mso-yhrn-brp. If you prefer to dial in, you can call +1 315-599-0319 and enter the PIN 174 515 123#.

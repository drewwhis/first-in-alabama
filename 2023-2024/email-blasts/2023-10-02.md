Hello teams!

October is here, which means qualifiers for Challenge will be starting in a month, and our Explore Festival is only six months away!

## Challenge Event Preferencing

All teams who preferenced have been assigned to their qualifiers. We were able to assign most teams to their first choice, so it was a smooth process this year! We sent the assignment notification to the coach who completed the form - if you did not receive your assignment, please check with the other coaches on your team first.

If you are the coach of a Challenge team who **did not complete** preferencing or **did not receive** an assignment, please contact us **as soon as possible** after checking with any co-coaches on your teams, and make sure to include your **team number**. We will make every attempt to place unassigned teams to events that have open capacity, but we cannot make any promises for specific events.

As a reminder, Challenge teams preparing for qualifiers may find these documents helpful:

In addition, there have been seven [Challenge Updates](https://firstinspiresst01.blob.core.windows.net/first-in-show-masterpiece/fll-challenge/fll-challenge-masterpiece-challenge-updates.pdf) since the season launch on August 1, so make sure to review these with your teams!

As a reminder, we will have event registration for our Explore teams sometime in January 2024.

## Express Enrollment - Youth Registration

All youths should be registered with their teams through *FIRST*. This season, a new application called Express Enrollment has been launched, offering parents a quick (around two minutes) path to registering their children with your team!

[Instructions for Coaches](https://www.firstinspires.org/sites/default/files/uploads/resource_library/express-enrollment-youth-registration-mentors.pdf) are available, as are [Instructions for Parents](https://www.firstinspires.org/sites/default/files/uploads/resource_library/express-enrollment-youth-registration-parents.pdf). You can also refer to the [Express Enrollment FAQ](https://www.firstinspires.org/sites/default/files/uploads/resource_library/express-enrollment-youth-registration-faq.pdf) if you have questions.

If you have gone through this process in the past, you should find this new experience much improved! In summary, the workflow is:
1. Coaches create invitation links/QR codes to share with parents (from the [Dashboard](https://my.firstinspires.org/Dashboard/))
2. Parents use the links/QR codes to apply their youths to the team through the Express Enrollment portal
3. Coaches can accept or decline applications from their [Dashboard](https://my.firstinspires.org/Dashboard/) by clicking on the `Youth Members` link for the team

Please refer to the documentation provided for additional information.


## Weekly Office Hours

Office hours are an opportunity for coaches to call in with questions about anything relating to *FIRST*<sup>&reg;</sup> or *FIRST* LEGO League. While we expect most questions will come from our Challenge folks, these sessions are open to all three levels - Challenge, Explore, and Discover!

We are moving the sessions to **Wednesdays** from 4:30 PM to 5:30 PM. All times are Central. The sessions will be hosted in Google Meet at https://meet.google.com/mso-yhrn-brp. If you prefer to dial in, you can call +1 315-599-0319 and enter the PIN 174 515 123#.

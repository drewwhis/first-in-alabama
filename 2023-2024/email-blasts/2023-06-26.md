Hello teams!

Welcome to the 2023-2024 season [*FIRST*<sup>&reg;</sup> IN SHOW<sup>SM</sup> presented by Qualcomm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTvP165wi3E) and *FIRST*<sup>&reg;</sup> LEGO<sup>&reg;</sup> League [MASTERPIECE<sup>SM</sup>](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QArg43rCMBA).

If you haven't already, you can log into your [*FIRST* Dashboard](https://my.firstinspires.org/Dashboard/) to update your personal and team information. This is a great time to agree to the annual policies, complete Youth Protection Policy (YPP) screening if yours has expired, create new teams, and mark existing teams as returning. See our pages on registering an [Existing Team](https://github.com/drewwhis/first-in-alabama/wiki/Register-an-EXISTING-Team) or a [New Team](https://github.com/drewwhis/first-in-alabama/wiki/Adding-a-NEW-Team) for more information.

## Team Grants Available

*FIRST* provides a [Grant Locator Tool](https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/team-grants) for teams to find active grants that may apply to them, and some of these grants are available now! For teams in the Tennessee Valley Authority service area, the Tennessee Valley Robotics Grant may provide some funding.

Make sure to check the tool frequently as grants will be added and removed throughout the year!


## Closing

Be aware that *FIRST* Headquarters will be closed the **entire** week of July 3rd-7th. We will likely begin weekly emails shortly after, so keep an eye out! Please reach out if you have any questions, and we hope to see you at an event this season!

# Judging and Advancement

This page describes the robot game, the judging process, the advancement criteria, the awards, and the wild card process for qualifiers in the **Alabama** region for the *FIRST*<sup>&reg;</sup> LEGO<sup>&reg;</sup> League 2019-2020 season, CITY SHAPER<sup>SM</sup>.

All definitions and descriptions apply **only** to the Alabama region and **only** for the CITY SHAPER<sup>SM</sup> season.

## Qualifier

For this document, we are considering a single qualifier. A qualifier includes **up to** 12 individual *FIRST*<sup>&reg;</sup> LEGO<sup>&reg;</sup> League teams.

Teams at a qualifier compete with other teams **at the same qualifier**.

The results of a single qualifier **do not** affect the results of any other qualifier.


## Robot Game

Every team at a qualifier participates in the robot game. 

There will be one Practice Round, so each team at the qualifier will participate in one Practice Match. The Practice Round will take place during the morning of the qualifier, prior to the Opening Ceremony and concurrently with Judging. This match does not count toward judging, awards, or advancement. It serves as an opportunity for the team to prepare for the Competition Rounds.

There will be three Competition Rounds, so each team at the qualifier will participate in three Competition Matches. Each match will be two minutes and thirty seconds long. The Competition Rounds will take place during the afternoon of the qualifier, following the Opening Ceremony. These matches are considered as part of judging, awards, and advancement. 

While each team will participate in three Competition Matches, only the team's single highest score will be considered in the judging, awards, and advancement. For example, a team that scores 50, 80, and 150 points will **only** have the 150 point match considered. The other match scores will be ignored **unless** there is a tie among highest-score matches, then the second-highest scores will be considered. If you have questions on the high-score-ranking system, please contact the [Alabama Judge Advisor](mailto:dwhisenant@FIRSTinAlabama.org).


## Judging

Every team at a qualifier participates in judging. There are three **separate** parts to judging. If you have questions about the judging process, please contact the [Alabama Judge Advisor](mailto:dwhisenant@FIRSTinAlabama.org).


### Robot Design

Every team at a qualifier participates in Robot Design judging.

The team will have four minutes to deliver the Robot Design Executive Summary (RDES) to the judges. The RDES is meant to briefly outline the key elements of the team's robot and design process and allow the team to focus on the most important aspects. The RDES is not meant to be as extensive or exhaustive as the Innovation Project (for comparision) but should give judges the information the team wants them to have. A written copy of the RDES is **not** required. For an overview of the RDES, see [this document](https://github.com/drewwhis/first-in-alabama/blob/main/2019-2020/fll/robot-design-executive-summary.md).

Following the delivery of the Robot Design Executive Summary, the team will have a six-minute Question-and-Answer period with the judges. Bear in mind that Robot Design judging will focus more on the engineering and design of the robot than its performance in Competition Matches.

Teams will be provided feedback in the form of the Robot Design Rubric at the conclusion of the competition. Be aware that the rubric does not *grade* the team; it is a tool used to organize throughts about the team's development. You can see and study the Robot Design Rubric with your team [within the combined rubrics document](https://www.firstinspires.org/sites/default/files/uploads/resource_library/fll/city-shaper/first-lego-league-rubrics.pdf).

Be aware that for this season there will **not** be a competition table in the judging room, nor will there be a mat and models. If the team wishes to demonstrate some aspect of the robot, they are welcome to do so, but there will **not** be a Challenge Set in the room.

In addition, your team should bring a **printed copy** of their robot code to **leave** with the judges. It is *very* difficult to judge a team's programming without a copy of the code available.


### Innovation Project

Every team at a qualifier participates in Innovation Project judging. In order to be considered "participating" in the Innovation Project, a team must demonstrate **all** of: Problem Identification, Team Solution, and Sharing.

The team's Innovation Project must address a problem in the Challenge in order to be considered as participating in Innovation Project judging. The Challenge for 2019-2020 is: **Identify** a problem with a building or public space in your community, **Design** a solution, and **Share** your solution with others and then refine it.

Teams will have five minutes to deliever their Innovation Project Presentation to the judges. The presentation should cover as much of the Innovation Project as possible within the time constraints.

Following the presentation, the team will have a five-minute Question-and-Answer period with their judges. During this time, the team may be asked about anything from their season or the Innovation Project Presentation (from the perspective of the Innovation Project).

Teams will be provided feedback in the form of the Innovation Project Rubric at the conclusion of the competition. Be aware that the rubric does not *grade* the team; it is a tool used to organize throughts about the team's development. You can see and study the Innovation Project Rubric with your team [within the combined rubrics document](https://www.firstinspires.org/sites/default/files/uploads/resource_library/fll/city-shaper/first-lego-league-rubrics.pdf).

If your team is planning an electronic presentation, such as a PowerPoint or other slideshow, you **must** contact your event manager to ensure that appropriate equipment is available at the event. You have **no guarantee** that suitable equipment will be available for the presentation, so you must make prior arrangements.


### Core Values

Every team at a qualifier participates in Core Values judging. 

Teams will have five minutes to complete a Teamwork Activity for a pair of judges. The judges will use the activity to gauge how the team approaches and solves problems *together*.

Following the activity, the team will have a five-minute Question-and-Answer period with their judges. During this time, the team may be asked about anything from their season or the Teamwork Activity (from the perspective of the Core Values).

Teams will be provided feedback in the form of the Core Values Rubric at the conclusion of the competition. Be aware that the rubric does not *grade* the team; it is a tool used to organize throughts about the team's development. You can see and study the Core Values Rubric with your team [within the combined rubrics document](https://www.firstinspires.org/sites/default/files/uploads/resource_library/fll/city-shaper/first-lego-league-rubrics.pdf).

Please note that the Core Values Poster is **not** required for judging this year and there is **no time** built into the schedule for the poster. The team *may* create a poster and refer to it during the Question-and-Answer period if they choose.


### All Judging

In all, the team will participate in three separate judging sessions. Though each session focuses on a unique aspect of the program, there are some components the sessions have in common.

- In all sessions, only the 10 students and 2 coaches are allowed in the judging room.
- Teams will see two judges in each session.
- The Robot Design and Innovation Project sessions **can** be filmed. The Core Values session **cannot** be filmed.
- Do not leave **anything** with the judges that you need back. Make sure you leave *disposable* copies.
- Teams will be provided feedback based on an area rubric at the end of the competition.
- Coaches are not allowed to do anything other than observe. This means active support, such as signaling the team and helping set up a presentation, are prohibited.


### Team Information Sheet

In addition to the judging sessions, your team will provide a Team Information Sheet to the event manager. This provides the judges with more information about your team, and you can reference specific parts of the sheet during your judging sessions.


## Awards

At a qualifier, there are five judged awards, one performance award, and two additional awards. If you have questions about the awards, please contact the [Alabama Judge Advisor](mailto:dwhisenant@FIRSTinAlabama.org).

## Advancement

Some of the teams at a qualifier will be chosen to advance to the Alabama Championship. Advancement is based on Competition Rounds, Robot Design Judging, Innovation Project Judging, and Core Values Judging. Advancing teams are determined by the judges through a deliberations process.

At a qualifier, 40% of teams will advance (rounding down). 

| Teams   | Advancing |
| ------- | --------- |
| Under 7 | 2 teams   |
| 8-9     | 3 teams   |
| 10-12   | 4 teams   |

One of the advancing teams is the Champions Award winner. **No other award** guarantees advancement. Some advancing teams may not win any awards, and some award-winning teams may not advance.

Teams advancing to the state championship will be announced during the qualifier's award ceremony. If you have questions about the advancement process, please contact the [Alabama Judge Advisor](mailto:dwhisenant@FIRSTinAlabama.org).


## Wild Cards

After the advancing teams are determined, the judges will select wild card teams using the same criteria. A wild card team, simply, is a team that *would* advance if the qualifier could advance more teams.

Wild card teams will be announced during the qualifier's award ceremony. 

After the last qualifier of the season, we will determine if we have any open spots at the state championship. We have space for 36 teams at the state championship, and we will advance **up to** 28 teams directly from the qualifiers.

To fill the remaining eight (or more) spots, we will randomly select teams from the wild card pool until we have a full championship. We will select these teams on **December 15, 2019**, the day after the final qualifiers.

Be aware that if you are announced as a wild card team at your qualifier, you do **not** have a guarantee of advancing to the state championship, but you do have the chance to advance even after your qualifier is over (so please keep practicing after your qualifier). Wild card teams will also be advanced to the state championship if other teams who advanced from their qualifiers are unable to attend.

If you have any questions about the wild card process, please contact the [Alabama Judge Advisor](mailto:dwhisenant@FIRSTinAlabama.org).

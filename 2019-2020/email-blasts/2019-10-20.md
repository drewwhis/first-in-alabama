Hello teams!

As we enter the last couple of weeks of October, we're getting close to the *FIRST*<sup>&reg;</sup> LEGO<sup>&reg;</sup> League Qualifiers! (And closer to the *FIRST*<sup>&reg;</sup> LEGO<sup>&reg;</sup> League Jr. Alabama Expo!)


## Preparing for an FLL Qualifier

With the first qualifier under a month away, now is a good time to make sure you'll be able to check every box at competition!

First, read **thoroughly** the [Judging and Advancement Document](https://github.com/drewwhis/first-in-alabama/blob/main/2019-2020/fll/judging-and-advancement.md) for our region. It will tell you **everything** you need to expect on the day of the event.

One form you'll notice on there is the Team Information Sheet. **Every** team should complete a team information sheet and return it to your qualifier manager. If you did not receive information from your qualifier manager in the past week, you should hear from them by Friday of this week.

Finally, make sure to read the [Game Guide](https://firstinspiresst01.blob.core.windows.net/fll/2020/city-shaper-game-guide-a4.pdf) thoroughly and keep up with the [Challenge Updates](https://firstinspiresst01.blob.core.windows.net/fll/2020/city-shaper-challenge-updates.pdf) and the [FLL Forum](https://forums.usfirst.org/forum/general-discussions/first-programs/first-lego-league).


## FLL Table Test Registration

We are inviting all *FIRST*<sup>&reg;</sup> LEGO<sup>&reg;</sup> League teams to ADTRAN in Huntsville, AL, on November 2 for a table test event!

Each team can sign up for a 30-minute block of time, and we can support six teams concurrently. The event will run from 10 AM to 3 PM, but keep in mind that, due to space limitations, you should only be on-site for your 30-minute window.

To register, enter your team **number** and select your time block using [our Doodle form](). **DO NOT** enter personal or team names. Any entry that **is not** a registered team number will be removed. We ask that everyone planning to attend sign up for a slot **no later than** Wednesday, October 30.


## FLL Q&A

Because we aren't having the scrimmage we originally intended for October 26, we will be holding an **online** question and answer session. I (Drew) will be facilitating that day, and we welcome our coaches, qualifier managers, head referees, and judge advisors.

The session will run from 1:00 PM until (at least) 3:00 PM (I'll continue as long as we get questions!). Be on the lookout for a link to go out on Friday night (Oct. 25) about 7:00 PM CDT.


## FLL Jr. Alabama Expo

Don't forget that the FLL Jr. Alabama Expo will be held on April 4, 2020 at the von Braun Center in Huntsville, AL. Registration will open in January 2020, so there's still time to start a team!


## Slack

One tool we use throughout the year is the *FIRST*<sup>&reg;</sup> in Alabama Slack Workspace. It's a great way to connect with the Partners, the *FIRST*<sup>&reg;</sup> Senior Mentor, and other coaches. We also use it to take remote attendee questions during our workshops.

You can join the Slack using [our invite link](https://join.slack.com/t/firstinalabama/shared_invite/enQtNDYxMTEzMTcwOTk0LWQzYmFjM2Q5MGNjNjFlM2M5ZTY4ZGNmM2VmY2Y0OTUwNTRiMjRlYTUwYTI2YTdjNGM0ZWZlYjM3MGVmNDY4YmY).

Once you've joined, make sure to follow the appropriate channels (we have multiple channels for FLL and a separate channel for FLL Jr.). 

To learn more about using Slack, you can check out [their documentation](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/categories/360000049043).

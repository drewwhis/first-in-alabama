For those teams whose season has finished, we hope you students learned a lot this season and that you will consider volunteering at a qualifier or the state championship (we have information posted [here](https://github.com/drewwhis/alabama-first-lego-league/wiki/Becoming-an-Event-Volunteer)). It's a great way to learn new things about the program you can take back to your teams or introduce to new people working with your teams.

Please be aware that you will continue to receive emails this season until at least December 15. After that date, communications will be restricted to teams attending the state championship and teams still in the Wild Card pool.

I hope you all enjoy the upcoming Thanksgiving holiday, and we look forward to seeing many of you on December 7!

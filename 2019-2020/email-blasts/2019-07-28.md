Hello teams!

We now return you to your regularly scheduled weekly emails!

This is the last (planned) email before Challenge Release (and the month of August)! If you'd like a super secret, sneak preview, you can [click here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ).<sup>*</sup>

Make sure to check [past emails](https://github.com/drewwhis/alabama-first-lego-league/tree/master/2019-2020/email-blasts) and [the FAQ](https://github.com/drewwhis/alabama-first-lego-league/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions) for anything you might've missed, like grant opportunities or how to join/leave teams.

## Challenge Release

*FIRST*<sup>&reg;</sup> LEGO<sup>&reg;</sup> League and *FIRST*<sup>&reg;</sup> LEGO<sup>&reg;</sup> League Jr. Challenge Release is coming!

**August 1** at **11 AM CDT** wherever you are! Each kickoff video will be posted on the respective program's YouTube channel. You'll be able to watch the FLL Challenge Release on the [FLL YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/FLLGlobal). You can learn about the FLL Jr. Challenge Release from the [FLL Jr. page](https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/flljr/challenge-and-season).

BUT WAIT... THERE'S MORE!

*FIRST* is planning a Twitch broadcast on **August 15** at **11 AM CDT** to walk FLL and FLL Jr. teams through the season materials. This event is tentative, so we'll be sharing more information closer to time.

FLL has some pretty significant changes coming this season, so this broadcast should be extremely valuable. Be on the lookout around this date for clarifications and specifications about this season's judging and advancement policies in our region.

Finally, remember that having two registered coach/mentors and paying your registration and challenge set fees ASAP is the best way to receive your season materials in a timely fashion!


## Standards Alignment

Many of you head back this week to get ready for the 2019-2020 academic year, and *FIRST* has some resources available that might help!

You can find the FLL Standards Alignment Maps for 4th Grade, 5th Grade, and 6th-8th Grade [here](https://www.firstinspires.org/resource-library/fll/standard-alignment-map). These maps align to the Common Core State Standards and Next Generation Science Standards (which are the current basis for the ACCRS) as well as the 21st Century Learning Skills.

You can find the FLL Jr. Standards Alignment Maps for K-4th Grade [here](https://www.firstinspires.org/resource-library/flljr/standard-alignment-map). The FLL Jr. maps align to the same standard sets that the FLL maps do.


## Coaches Workshop Poll

We're still planning our top topics to hit for the upcoming workshop (but we'll cover everything we can!), and we'd LOVE your help!

If you haven't filled it out already, please complete our [workshop survey](). Note that the link is disabled on GitHub.

Each person who could potentially attend (in-person or remotely) should fill it out!


## Coaches Workshop Registration

Speaking of the Coaches Workshop, registration is open! We've set up an EventBrite event to record our attendees (link below).

Here are a few things to consider:
- Only those who are attending **in-person** need to register.
- There is no fee to register, but we do ask that you register in advance.
- You do not need to bring the registration/ticket with you.
- Registration closes on Friday, August 16 at 11:30 PM.

**Each in-person attendee** should register using [this link](). Note that the link is disabled on GitHub.

We will be sharing the broadcast information the week before the event, so if you're unable to join us in Huntsville, you'll still be able to join in the fun.

If you haven't joined yet, I recommend joining the *FIRST* in Alabama Slack! It's how we'll take questions from our remote attendees, and it's a great way to collaborate with other coaches, the *FIRST* Senior Mentor, and the FLL and FLL Jr. Partners.

You can join our Slack with [this link]() (make sure to join the right channels). Note that the link is disabled on GitHub. You can learn more about using Slack [from this link](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/categories/360000049043).

## Bedtime Math Summer Road Trip

*FIRST* LEGO League Jr. is joining Bedtime Math this summer for #50StatesofMath to give teams and families a great tool to make the M in STEM (math) fun! A new state is featured each day – learn more about [the activity](http://bedtimemath.org/road-trip-flljr/) and see if your state’s been featured.

## Closing

If you have any questions or issues, please let us know at FLL@FIRSTinAlabama.org or directly message one of us in the *FIRST* in Alabama Slack!

Otherwise, we'll see you on the other side of Challenge Release!

Best,

Drew and Taylor Whisenant

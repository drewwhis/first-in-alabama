Hello teams!

Since we have wrapped up qualifier registration, I wanted to send a final update to our non-competing contacts. This is the last message you'll receive for this season (CITY SHAPER<sup>SM</sup>), **unless you are affiliated with other**, competing teams.

## Leaving Teams

If you are no longer affiliated with any team but still receiving these messages, you may need to invite replacements or retire from your teams.

We have instructions on how to navigate this process posted [here in our FAQ](https://github.com/drewwhis/alabama-first-lego-league/wiki/Leaving-a-Team).


## *FIRST*<sup>&reg;</sup> in Alabama Events

Whether you no longer have teams or were just testing the waters this year, volunteering at events for *FIRST*<sup>&reg;</sup> in Alabama is a great opportunity! Veteran coaches bring a wealth of knowledge and experience to the process while newbies have a chance to learn more about the programs without waiting a whole year!

We have information about how to become a volunteer [posted here](https://github.com/drewwhis/alabama-first-lego-league/wiki/Becoming-an-Event-Volunteer). If you are interested and have questions about volunteering, let us know! Our events would not be possible without the support of volunteers.


## Next Season

It's never too early to start planning for next season. Registration opens around mid-May each year, so we currently expect registration to open for the 2020-2021 season *around* May 15.

For *FIRST*<sup>&reg;</sup> LEGO<sup>&reg;</sup> League, the \$225 registration fee and the \$75 Challenge Set fee can be paid as soon as registration opens for the new season. So if you pay your fees in May, you will receive materials as soon as they begin shipping!

Also keep in mind that we **do not** currently have a guarantee for TVA funding for the 2020-2021 season, so that funding may not be available next season.

If you have fundraising or grant opportunities arise over the next few months, I would pursue them quickly and be ready to start in May! For reference, we only had eight (8) Alabama teams complete registration in May (and only a handful during the summer). 

**If** you are able to get fully registered in the early summer, you will get to avoid a lot of the scramble (administratively) around Challenge Release next year. I'd also add that teams registering early help with planning and scheduling events!


## Closing

We are sorry that some teams will not be joining us in competition this season, but we look forward to the opportunity to welcome those teams next season. If you have questions about getting a team started, sustaining an existing team, or taking over an existing team, please feel free to reach out to us at FLL@FIRSTinAlabama.org.

We hope to see you at an event this season, and we hope your team(s) join us next season!

Best,

Drew and Taylor Whisenant

Hello teams!

Happy New Year and congratulations again on your advancement to the *FIRST*<sup>&reg;</sup> LEGO<sup>&reg;</sup> League Alabama Championship! We are looking forward to seeing you on January 25, 2020 at Hampton Cove Middle School.

## Schedules and Team Numbers

This year, we will be replacing your team number at the state event! All teams will be assigned a number from 1 to 36. We've included the list here as well as your team schedules for state! We've sent the schedules off to print, so we do not anticipate any changes.

For questions about the schedule, please contact Taylor at twhisenant@FIRSTinAlabama.org.


## Team Information Sheet

**Please use your 1-36 team number on your Team Information Sheet, not your registered team number.**

We ask that you complete and email the Team Information Sheet in advance of the event. 

Please email your completed sheet to dwhisenant@FIRSTinAlabama.org no later than **next** Saturday, January 11, 2020. 

This will give us plenty of time to get them printed for the judges.


## Payment

The fee to compete in the event is \$100. You can submit payment to:

    FIRST in Alabama
    3002 Boundary Oaks Drive
    Owens Cross Roads, AL 35763

Make sure to include your TEAM NUMBER so we know where to apply the payment!

If you need an invoice or W-9, email Taylor at twhisenant@FIRSTinAlabama.org.


## Lunch

We will be sending lunch order information next week for teams that wish to order lunches. You are not obligated to purchase lunches, and you may make your own arrangements.

There is a 30 minute break in the schedule from 11:00 to 11:30 dedicated to lunch, immediately followed by the Opening Ceremonies. You also have your team schedule, so you should be able to plan accordingly.


## Judging and Awards

Judging expectations remain the same from the qualifiers. If you need a refresher, refer to the [Judging and Advancement](https://github.com/drewwhis/alabama-first-lego-league/blob/main/2019-2020/fll/judging-and-advancement.md) document.

Remember that for judging we do not guarantee the availability of AV equipment. If you require AV equipment, you will need to supply your own. Please also remember that setup (AV or non-AV) is **included** in your judging time (*e.g.*, if it takes two minutes to set up your Innovation Project Presentation, you only have three minutes left to present).


## Closing

If you have questions or need to request accommodations, please let us know at FLL@FIRSTinAlabama.org.

We look forward to a great state championship event!

Best,

Drew and Taylor Whisenant

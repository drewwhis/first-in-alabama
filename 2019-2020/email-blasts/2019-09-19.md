Hello teams!

With our registration deadline upon us and our technical workshop for coaches on Saturday, I wanted to do one final check-in for everyone.


## Coaches Technical Workshop

The Coaches Technical Workshop is Saturday, September 21, 2019, at the University of Alabama in Huntsville. Those attending should enter the doors on the south-side of the **Shelby Center for Technology** (the building is on the east-side of Sparkman Drive). We will be in rooms 158, 107, and 109 (all on the first floor).

The workshop will begin at 1:00 PM. There will be three tracks: Beginner (158), Intermediate (107), and Advanced (109). Each track will be broken into three, one-hour(ish) lessons, so we hope to wrap up about 4:00 PM.

- Beginner
  - WeDo 2.0 Programming/Programming Resources (FLL Jr.)
  - Introduction to the EV3 Brick and Software (FLL)
  - Moving Straight/Basic Turning/Pseudocode
- Intermediate
  - Advantages and Disadvantages of Sensors
  - Line Following and Gyro Sensors
  - My Blocks and Setting Parameters
- Advanced
  - Source Control
  - EV3 Python
  - PID Theory and Control

You are welcome to change tracks between sessions, but we don't recommend changing tracks in the middle of a session.

We do not anticipate being able to stream the sessions due to the nature of the event, but we will post any materials to the GitHub that we can after the event.

If you plan on attending, here are some things you might consider bringing:
- A charged EV3 (with parts)
- A charged WeDo (if you plan on participating in the single WeDo session)
- A laptop you can install software on (a personal Windows or Mac computer) OR a device with the LEGO software already installed
- A microSD card (if you plan on participating in any sessions on Python) 

We expect the sessions to offer you time to play around with the concepts, so bringing your supplies will give you more to do!

We ask that everyone attending register in advance through the [EventBrite page](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/alabama-coaches-technical-workshop-tickets-71315902785) ASAP if you have not already done so.


## Eligible Teams

These are the teams that we are confirming as **eligible to register** for a qualifier. That information will be sent out sometime on Saturday, September 21, and you will have a week to complete event registration. We use a ranked-preference system, so do **not** stress about getting registered on Saturday, but do complete the form in a timely manner. Remember that we will **only** send the form to Lead Coach/Mentor 1.

## Other Teams

These teams are **not** currently eligible to register for a qualifier (though that will change if the registration is paid by Friday, September 20). I appreciate that some of you have let me know that a team is inactive, but I cannot do anything with that information, as *FIRST* does not remove teams from the listing. If you need to be removed from an old team, you can read the FAQ for directions.

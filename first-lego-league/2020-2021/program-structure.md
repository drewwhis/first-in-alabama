# *FIRST*&reg; LEGO&reg; League

Starting with the 2020-2021 season, there have been some structural changes to our program. If you were familiar with *FIRST*&reg; LEGO&reg; League, *FIRST*&reg; LEGO&reg; League Jr., or *FIRST*&reg; LEGO&reg; League Jr. Discovery Edition in past seasons, these programs are now all under the *FIRST*&reg; LEGO&reg; League umbrella as one unified program with three divisions.

Some highlights are captured here for easy reference. You can refer to the [*FIRST*&reg; website](https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/fll) for more information.

## Explore

In Explore, teams of students ages 6-10 focus on the fundamentals of engineering as they explore real-world problems, learn to design, and code and create unique solutions made with LEGO&reg; bricks and powered by LEGO&reg; Education WeDo 2.0.

This division is targeted towards students in **Second through Fourth Grade**.

This division was previously known as *FIRST*&reg; LEGO&reg; League Jr.

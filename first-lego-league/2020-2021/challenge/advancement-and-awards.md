# Advancement and Awards

During a competition, teams will participate in judging and robot performance rounds.


## Evaluation

During the judging process, teams are evaluated in three areas: Core Values, Innovation Project, and Robot Design. Each team's scores in these three areas are determined using the judging rubrics. These scores are based on their relative ranking to other teams, not their raw score. For example, in a competition of four teams, each team receives a ranking (1-4) in each of the three areas.

During performance rounds, teams are evaluated on their robot *ranking*, not their score. For example, in a tournament of four teams, each team receives a ranking (1-4) in terms of robot performance. Teams are ranked based on their **single highest score**.

These four scores are added together to compute the Champion's Score.

    Champion's Score = Innovation Project Rank + Core Values Rank + Robot Design Rank + Robot Performance Rank

In a tournament of four teams, for example, the best possible Champion's Score is 4, by placing first in all three judging areas and in the robot performance rounds (1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4) while the lowest possible score is 16, placing last in all three judging areas and in the robot performance rounds (4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 16).

Note that robot performance *points* and judging rubric *points* do not directly affect the Champion's Score - only the relative ranking of the teams is considered.


## Champion's Award and Advancement

The Champion's Score is used by the judges to determine the Champion's Award winner and the advancing teams. In all but the rarest cases, those will correspond to the teams with the highest Champion's Score and who are the **most well-rounded** across the four areas.


## Coach/Mentor Award

The Coach/Mentor Award is not based on the Champion's Score. Instead, it is handled through a separate nomination process.


## Robot Performance Award

The Robot Performance Award is based **only** on the robot performance rounds and is awarded to the team with the single highest score for the competition.


## Core Values, Innovation Project, and Robot Design Awards

These awards are based solely on the ranks within their respective judging areas. For example, the Core Values Award is based **only** on Core Values Judging. Likewise, the Robot Design Award is based **only** on Robot Design Judging and is not impacted by the robot performance rounds.


## Other Awards

Any other awards not described above are considered holistically by the judges, considering a team's entire body of work, not exclusively their robot performance, judging, or Champion's Score rankings.

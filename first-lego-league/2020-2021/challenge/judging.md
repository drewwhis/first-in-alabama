# Judging

There are some major changes to judging this season. The biggest change is that teams will no longer attend three separate sessions.

Each team will attend a single judging session for 30 minutes that covers all three areas (Core Values, Robot Design, and Innovation Project). Teams can expect two or three judges in the room. In the Alabama region, we are planning for three judges in each room.


## Schedule

Judging sessions will follow this format at both qualifiers and the championship. You can find these details [on the flowchart](https://firstinspiresst01.blob.core.windows.net/first-game-changers/fll-challenge/Judging-Session-for-Teams.pdf), as well.

- 2 Minutes: Team Welcome
- 5 Minutes: Innovation Project Presentation
- 5 Minutes: Innovation Project Q&A
- 5 Minutes: Robot Design Explanation
- 5 Minutes: Robot Design Q&A
- 3 Minutes: Core Values Reflection
- 5 Minutes: Judge Feedback

In total, you will notice that only about 10 minutes of the session is allocated for things the team is presenting (IP Presentation, RD Explanation, CV Reflection) while 13 minutes is set aside for Q&A and reflection. The remaining time is for welcome and feedback from the judges.


## Innovation Project

During the five minute presentation, the team should make sure to address how they identified their problem, explain their solution and how they created/tested it, and describe how and with whom their shared their solution.

Refer to the Innovation Project rubric for more guidance. The better the judges can complete the rubric based on your presentation and the follow-up Q&A, the better your score!

Please be aware that if your presentation is longer than five minutes, the judges may cut you off for the Q&A period!


## Robot Design

During the five minute explanation, the team should explain the robot's design and code as well as the process the team used to develop the robot.

During the explanation, you **won't** use a mat and models, so make sure you can talk about your robot **without a field**. This is also true at virtual events, so save your models for the performance rounds!

Refer to the Robot Design rubric for more guidance. The better the judges can complete the rubric based on your explanation and the follow-up Q&A, the better your score!

Please be aware that if your explanation is longer than five minutes, the judges may cut you off for the Q&A period!


## Core Values

During the three minute reflection, the judges will ask some questions about the team's Core Values. These questions are meant to address anything about Core Values not covered during the Innovation Project and Robot Design portions of judging. The judges may also ask questions about Core Values during the welcome time of judging (at the very beginning), so be ready while you're setting up!

Refer to the Core Values rubric for more guidance. The better the judges can complete the rubric based on your Innovation Project Presentation, Robot Design Explanation, and reflection, the better your score!

Do note that there is relatively little time exclusively devoted to Core Values in the judging session, so it will be the hardest for judges to score. It is in your best interest to incorporate your Core Values into the Innovation Project Presentation and Robot Design Explanation as much as possible, just as you should incorporate Core Values into everything you do!


## Feedback

This season, judges will offer some feedback for teams in the judging room! They will be offering comments on things teams did well as well as things the team can improve on.

The team will also receive written feedback following the event, but this is an opportunity for immediate feedback.


## Rubrics

Judges will complete the same rubrics that have been provided to teams. When the event is over, teams will receive their filled-out rubrics, complete with feedback. During the event, these rubrics will serve as a component of the team's evaluation.

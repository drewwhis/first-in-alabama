Hello teams!

You are receiving this message because you are listed as a paid or rookie FLL Challenge team with *FIRST*. Following state registration, emails will only go to those teams who register for the state event.

With our scrimmages all wrapped up, we are getting ready for the state championship. You can expect a very similar process for state that you saw for the scrimmages.

We are including some checklists here for all participants. **Please start looking at these today.** 

## Register for State

We are asking teams to submit [this form]() to register for the state tournament. To be eligible, a team must have completely registered with *FIRST*, including paying your team registration fees.

Please complete the form **no later than Tuesday, March 23**. This will give us time to get everyone's time scheduled appropriately (ideally by the following week). As a reminder, the state championship will be held virtually on April 10. You will submit robot rounds during the week of the event and have a judging session in the morning. There will also be an awards ceremony Zoom meeting in the afternoon.

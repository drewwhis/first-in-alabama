Hello teams!

We don't have any new updates since last week, but please check our messages and resources for useful information!

# Survey

We are currently working on topics and materials for upcoming (virtual) workshops for coaches! If you have ideas for topics, please fill out [this form](). Note that the link is disabled in GitHub. We are planning to offer multiple workshops, so all ideas are welcome!


# Discord

Our Discord is available to coaches, mentors, parents, volunteers, and students (aged 13 and older) across all *FIRST*® programs! We have opted to move to Discord (across all programs) because it is very similar to Slack with the benefit that many students (especially high school students) are using it already! Like Slack, it can also be used to communicate with other coaches or with *FIRST*® staff. To learn more about using Discord, you can check out their [Beginner's Guide](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360045138571).

There is **no requirement or expectation** that you or anyone with your team use the Discord. We are simplify offering it as another avenue for members of our community to receive direct information. One benefit of the Discord is early access to information! We only plan to email teams once per week, but if we get helpful-but-not-urgent information, it'll go in the Discord first!
 
To join the Discord as a member of the *FIRST*® LEGO® League program, you can use and share this link - [Join Discord](). Note that the link is disabled on GitHub.
 
If you are involved in multiple programs, you can add the other programs after you've joined! If you have questions, feel free to reach out.

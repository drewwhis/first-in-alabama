## TVA *FIRST*® Grants

TVA has decided to offer registration grants to teams in the TVA service area again this year! FLL Explore teams can receive \$130 for Registration, the Explore Set, tax, and shipping. FLL Challenge teams can receive \$363 Registration, the Challenge Set, tax, and shipping.

Teams must begin the registration process with *FIRST*® and hold a temporary team (if a Rookie team) or team number (Veteran teams). Teams must **NOT pay** for registration as it will **forfeit** their TVA Grant. **No exceptions, substitutions or refunds will be made.**

TVA team grants are available on a first-come, first-served basis. Funds will be available until December 1, 2020, or until funds for the grant have been utilized. All teams interested in receiving TVA funds must submit a very [short online application](https://usfirst.submittable.com/submit/04c6ff8c-5a5e-4a2a-a4f9-178cea6308d2/2020-2021-tennessee-valley-authority-team-grant-application).


# Discord

Our Discord is available to coaches, mentors, parents, volunteers, and students (aged 13 and older) across all *FIRST*® programs! We have opted to move to Discord (across all programs) because it is very similar to Slack with the benefit that many students (especially high school students) are using it already! Like Slack, it can also be used to communicate with other coaches or with *FIRST*® staff. To learn more about using Discord, you can check out their [Beginner's Guide](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360045138571).

There is **no requirement or expectation** that you or anyone with your team use the Discord. We are simplify offering it as another avenue for members of our community to receive direct information. One benefit of the Discord is early access to information! We only plan to email teams once per week, but if we get helpful-but-not-urgent information, it'll go in the Discord first!
 
To join the Discord as a member of the *FIRST*® LEGO® League program, you can use and share this link - [Join Discord](). Note that the link is disabled on GitHub.
 
If you are involved in multiple programs, you can add the other programs after you've joined! If you have questions, feel free to reach out.

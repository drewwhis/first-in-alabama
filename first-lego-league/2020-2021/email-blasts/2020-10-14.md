## *FIRST*® Professional Development Scholarship

There are several professional development offerings through *FIRST*® (details available [here](https://www.firstinspires.org/community/educators/professional-development)), and there is a scholarship available through the Overdeck Family Foundation. Each course is led by a *FIRST*® Certified Trainer and provides the necessary tools to bring *FIRST*® programs to your classroom or as a structured afterschool program. Certificates for continuing education or professional development credit are provided following the completion of the session. 

The scholarship is available for *FIRST*® Rookie and Veteran educators and parents within the United States for *FIRST*® LEGO® League (Discover, Explore, and Challenge) and *FIRST*® Tech Challenge programs. 

For more information or to apply for the grant, visit [this page](https://usfirst.submittable.com/submit/176117/2020-overdeck-family-foundation-scholarship-for-first-professional-development).


## TVA STEM Grants

**The deadline for this grant is this Friday, October 16.**

This year, TVA has grants available to teachers or school administrators in public or private schools, grades K-12 (Schools must be located in the TVA service area and receive power from a local power company served by TVA). The grants are available up to \$5,000 and the application is open through **October 16**. We're not sure what the timeline is for award or distribution, but you can learn more from [TVA's press release](https://www.tva.com/newsroom/press-releases/stem-grant-opportunity-for-k-12-tennessee-valley-educators-now-open).


# Additional Sets (Challenge and Explore)

Don't forget that Challenge and Explore teams can order one **additional** Challenge or Explore set this season! The RePLAY Challenge set is \$75, and the PLAYMAKERS Explore set is \$35 (all plus tax and shipping). *FIRST*® hopes this makes managing teams with some level of remote participation more possible for more teams!


# Discord

Our Discord is available to coaches, mentors, parents, volunteers, and students (aged 13 and older) across all *FIRST*® programs! We have opted to move to Discord (across all programs) because it is very similar to Slack with the benefit that many students (especially high school students) are using it already! Like Slack, it can also be used to communicate with other coaches or with *FIRST*® staff. To learn more about using Discord, you can check out their [Beginner's Guide](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360045138571).

There is **no requirement or expectation** that you or anyone with your team use the Discord. We are simplify offering it as another avenue for members of our community to receive direct information. One benefit of the Discord is early access to information! We only plan to email teams once per week, but if we get helpful-but-not-urgent information, it'll go in the Discord first!
 
To join the Discord as a member of the *FIRST*® LEGO® League program, you can use and share this link - [Join Discord](). Note that the link is disabled on GitHub.
 
If you are involved in multiple programs, you can add the other programs after you've joined! If you have questions, feel free to reach out.

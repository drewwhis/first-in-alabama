Hello teams!

It's hard to believe, but August is nearly over!

## Office Hours Schedule Update

Based on the August sessions and schedule, we're going to be updating our office hours schedule starting in September. **We will still have tomorrow's office hours as planned**.

Starting September 1, we will adjust our schedule to **every other Thursday** from **5 PM to 6 PM** and we will **drop the Tuesday** offering. Sessions will still be available [online](https://meet.google.com/mso-yhrn-brp) or via phone: +1 315-599-0319 (PIN: 174 515 123#).

As a reminder, our office hours are open for all three divisions (Challenge, Explore, and Discover), and for teams as well as Class Packs. If you can't make the new times, feel free to reach out via email or in the Discord server.


## *FIRST*<sup>&reg;</sup> Tech Challenge Kickoff

*FIRST* ENERGIZE<sup>SM</sup> presented by Qualcomm continues on Saturday, September 10th with the *FIRST* Tech Challenge (FTC) Kickoff for POWERPLAY<sup>SM</sup> presented by Raytheon Technologies. *FIRST* Tech Challenge is the next offering in the *FIRST* progression following *FIRST* LEGO League and is intended for students in grades seven through twelve (7-12).

*FIRST* in Alabama will be hosting a local kickoff event at the Invention to Innovation Center (I2C) at the University of Alabama in Huntsville to showcase this season's game. The event starts at 10 AM on September 10th, and you can learn more from [our Facebook event](https://fb.me/e/2rqT0bDO8).


## LEGO<sup>&reg;</sup> SPIKE App

The SPIKE App from LEGO is used to program both the SPIKE Prime (Challenge) and SPIKE Essential (Explore). It's a cross-platform app running on macOS, Windows, iPad, and even ChromeOS - though the experience is definitely best on a non-Chromebook device. 

The device can be installed from [LEGO's site](https://education.lego.com/en-us/downloads/spike-app/software), just make sure to choose an installer and don't rely on the Web App - you can't guarantee an Internet connection at an event, so offline is best here.

The SPIKE App also features a ton of resources, including [lessons and unit plans](https://education.lego.com/en-us/lessons). These are great activities for your students or as development opportunities for you or your new coaches.

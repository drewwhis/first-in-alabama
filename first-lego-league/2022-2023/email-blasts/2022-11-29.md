Hello teams!

We hope you had a *recharging* holiday and are geared up for more *FIRST* LEGO League SUPERPOWERED!


## Challenge Qualifier Webinar Recording

Prior to the Thanksgiving holiday, we hosted our webinar for Challenge Qualifiers! If you missed out, you can view the recording [on our YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AkQqNsu73M0). If you have any questions that weren't addressed during the call, feel free to reach out!


## **Critical News** - LEGO SPIKE Updates

The LEGO SPIKE App is getting an update - Version 3! Version 3 will introduce a lot of new functionality, but it will also bring **breaking changes**. As a result, programs written using Version 2 of the app **ARE NOT COMPATIBLE** with Version 3 of the firmware. In addition, Python may not be wholly available at launch of Version 3, but it will definitely be available in a later update.

For these reasons, we strongly advise teams who are already working in their season **not** to upgrade to Version 3 and stay with Version 2 until the end of the season. We advise teams who have not yet started working also **not** to upgrade to Version 3 until the end of the season, but this is less strict.

The update will go live in early December. We would recommend that, if possible, you disable updates on your devices running the SPIKE App or completely disable the Internet connection on those devices. We also recommend backing up your programs and securing a device that will always be on Version 2 until the season is over.

You can learn more about the SPIKE App Version 3 from the [LEGO blog](https://community.legoeducation.com/blogs/36/210).


## Final Office Hours of 2022

We will have the final office hours of 2022 **next week**! We will host them from **5 PM to 6 PM** on **Wednesday, December 7**. As always, you can join [online](https://meet.google.com/mso-yhrn-brp) or via phone: +1 315-599-0319 (PIN: 174 515 123#).

Hello teams!

October is nearly over, which means event assignments are coming soon for our Challenge teams!

## Challenge Event Preferencing and Webinar

As a reminder, preferencing for Challenge team qualifiers is open until Friday, October 28. At this time, we have about ten teams left to register, so make sure to get those preferences in! We will be announcing placements on Monday, October 31 - we hope yours will be more treat than trick!

After placements are announced, we will also be scheduling a webinar (that will be recorded) where we will discuss what to expect at a qualifying event. Speakers include:
- Taylor Whisenant, *FIRST*<sup>&reg;</sup> LEGO<sup>&reg;</sup> League Program Delivery Partner for Alabama
- Jamie McClung, *FIRST* Senior Mentor and Veteran *FIRST* LEGO League Challenge Coach
- Chris Bero, *FIRST* LEGO League Challenge Head Referee for Alabama
- Drew Whisenant, *FIRST* LEGO League Challenge Judge Advisor for Alabama

We will announce the date/time in an email to follow.


## Challenge Updates and Clarifications

Make sure you are regularly checking the [Updates and Clarifications document](https://firstinspiresst01.blob.core.windows.net/season/challenge-updates.pdf) in addition to your Robot Game Rules and other guiding documents. Clarification 07 was released on October 18 - "DURING THE MATCH | INSIDE HOME - HANDLING â€“ Technicians may not hand anything from one home area to the other."

Remember, Updates and Clarifications supersede anything they conflict with in the Robot Game Rules, so make sure to keep up-to-date!

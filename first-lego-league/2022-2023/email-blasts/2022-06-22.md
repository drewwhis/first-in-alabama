Hello teams!

We hope your summers are going well! We have a few updates we'd like everyone to be aware of.

## Grant Opportunities

We are aware of a few grant opportunities already in the pipeline! First, make sure to regularly check the [Team Grant Opportunities Page](https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/team-grants). There are currently grants listed from Boeing and Raytheon that Challenge and Explore teams are eligible to receive.

We have been informed that there will be a limited number of grants available to teams in the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) service area. These grants will not come from TVA directly this season, and will be awarded on a first-come, first-serve basis. To be eligible, make sure that your team has [two lead coach/mentors](https://github.com/drewwhis/first-in-alabama/wiki/Inviting-Missing-Contacts) (**not** only Team Administrators) who have [completed Youth Protection Policy screening](https://github.com/drewwhis/first-in-alabama/wiki/Complete-Youth-Protection-Policy-Screening) and that you have **not** secured registration. We will share application information to all teams when it is available.

Finally, we have some information about this year's AMSTI Robotics Grant. The application is open on [AMSTI's site](https://www.amsti.org/robotics) until September 30, 2022. The grant covers up to \$3,500 **only** for robotics equipment, like the LEGO SPIKE sets (so you **cannot** pay registration fees with it). Because of the timeline of grant dispersal, we advise that you **do NOT rely on this grant for anything you need this season** - you will **not** receive funds in time.


## Office Hours

As announced in the last email, we'll be launching office hours this season! These will be one-hour virtual sessions offered twice weekly where coaches can drop in and ask questions about any number of *FIRST*<sup>&reg;</sup> or *FIRST*<sup>&reg;</sup> LEGO<sup>&reg;</sup> League topics! The sessions will not be recorded, but we will make sure to share any noteworthy developments that come out of them.

The sessions will be hosted by Drew Whisenant, Alabama *FIRST* LEGO League Challenge Judge Advisor, and other key personnel will be invited (though their attendance isn't guaranteed), including:
- Taylor Whisenant, Alabama *FIRST* LEGO League Program Delivery Partner
- Jamie McClung, Alabama *FIRST* Senior Mentor
- Chris Bero, Alabama *FIRST* LEGO League Challenge Head Referee
- Others!

If a topic comes up that one of our key personnel would be more suited to answer, we'll make sure to direct it to them! The current plan is to offer sessions:
- Tuesdays from 3 PM to 4 PM
- Thursdays from 6 PM to 7 PM

Our first office hours session will be on **Thursday, July 28, 2022** during the 6 PM to 7 PM time slot. This will provide you with an opportunity to check in and ask questions before the season launch on **Tuesday, August 2, 2022**.

Hello teams!

We've finished the first week of the Challenge qualifier season and are looking forward to more events this week!

## Challenge Qualifiers

Congratulations to all of our teams who competed in this past week's qualifier. You can find the results on our [Challenge Results page](https://github.com/drewwhis/first-in-alabama/blob/main/first-lego-league/2022-2023/challenge-results.md).

Good luck to all teams participating at the UAH SWE and Port City Qualifiers this week! We will have office hours again **this week** and next week on **Wednesday** from 5 PM to 6 PM. As always, you can join [online](https://meet.google.com/mso-yhrn-brp) or via phone: +1 315-599-0319 (PIN: 174 515 123#). Anyone is welcome to attend, not just people from teams competing that week.

As a reminder, if you have **general** questions about the game or season, you can contact me any time. If you have questions about **your specific qualifier**, please reach out to your qualifier manager.


## Explore Festival Registration

Registration is still open for the *FIRST*<sup>&reg;</sup> LEGO<sup>&reg;</sup> League Explore Alabama Festival - April 8, 2023 at the von Braun Center in Huntsville, AL.

All Explore teams that have completed their team registration via their *FIRST* Dashboard are eligible to attend. There is **no cost** to register.

To sign up for the Festival, please complete your registration [using our Registration Form](https://forms.office.com/r/LgHNNegNMe).


## Youth Team Member Registration

All *FIRST*<sup>&reg;</sup> participants, including those in *FIRST* LEGO<sup>&reg;</sup> League, are required to be registered with their teams. This is also the primary method for students to have their Consent and Release Forms completed. In *FIRST* LEGO League Challenge, the age (9-14) or grade (4th-8th) requirements are enforced at the time the student **signs up** for the team. Students in *FIRST* LEGO League Explore must also be registered with their teams.

*FIRST* has created a page to help with this process called the [Youth Registration System Overview](https://www.firstinspires.org/resource-library/youth-registration-system), with a section specific to helping [Lead Coaches/Mentors](https://www.firstinspires.org/resource-library/youth-registration-system#LeadCoachMentor) with the process. As a Coach, you should use Option 1 (included at the end of this email) to invite the **parents**. The parents will then add their own children following the [Instructions for Parents/Guardians](https://www.firstinspires.org/resource-library/youth-registration-system#parents), which you can share with them.

If you run into any issues with the process or have questions, you can reach out to [*FIRST*](mailto:firstteammembers@firstinspires.org?subject=Youth%20Registration%20System).

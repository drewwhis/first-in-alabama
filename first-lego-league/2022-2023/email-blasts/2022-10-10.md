Hello teams!

Don't forget that office hours are tomorrow from 5 PM to 6 PM.

## Youth Team Member Registration

All *FIRST*<sup>&reg;</sup> participants, including those in *FIRST* LEGO<sup>&reg;</sup> League, are required to be registered with their teams. This is also the primary method for students to have their Consent and Release Forms completed. In *FIRST* LEGO League Challenge, the age (9-14) or grade (4th-8th) requirements are enforced at the time the student **signs up** for the team. Students in *FIRST* LEGO League Explore must also be registered with their teams.

*FIRST* has created a page to help with this process called the [Youth Registration System Overview](https://www.firstinspires.org/resource-library/youth-registration-system), with a section specific to helping [Lead Coaches/Mentors](https://www.firstinspires.org/resource-library/youth-registration-system#LeadCoachMentor) with the process. As a Coach, you should use Option 1 (included at the end of this email) to invite the **parents**. The parents will then add their own children following the [Instructions for Parents/Guardians](https://www.firstinspires.org/resource-library/youth-registration-system#parents), which you can share with them.

If you run into any issues with the process or have questions, you can reach out to [*FIRST*](mailto:firstteammembers@firstinspires.org?subject=Youth%20Registration%20System).


## LEGO Product Pricing

A couple of months ago, LEGO increased their prices to reflect current market trends. *FIRST* has **not** yet increased their LEGO prices to reflect this change, and will not do so until January 2023. That being the case, if your team or Class Pack has LEGO product to order in your Dashboard (including Explore registrations, SPIKE Prime sets, SPIKE Essential sets, and Challenge Sets), it is strongly recommended you get your orders in before the end of the calendar year as *FIRST* will not be able to guarantee the current prices after the start of 2023.


## Challenge Event Preferencing

We will open event preferences for *FIRST*<sup>&reg;</sup> LEGO<sup>&reg;</sup> League Challenge one week from today - on October 17th. We will accept preferences until October 28th, and we plan to announce team placements on October 31st. To preference, your team will need to be registered and paid with *FIRST*, and we will send the information to Lead/Coach Mentor 1 for each team. If you are a Lead/Coach Mentor 2 or Team Admin for your team, make sure to coordinate with Lead/Coach Mentor 1 for your team(s). For more information, you can review last week's email in the archive.

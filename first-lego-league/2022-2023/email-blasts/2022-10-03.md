Hello teams!

With October here, we know many of you are gearing up for Fall Breaks as you approach mid-semester.


## Challenge Event Preferencing

We will open event preferences for *FIRST*<sup>&reg;</sup> LEGO<sup>&reg;</sup> League Challenge two weeks from today - on October 17th. We will accept preferences until October 28th, and we plan to announce team placements on October 31st. To preference, your team will need to be registered and paid with *FIRST*, and we will send the information to Lead/Coach Mentor 1 for each team. If you are a Lead/Coach Mentor 2 or Team Admin for your team, make sure to coordinate with Lead/Coach Mentor 1 for your team(s).

Our four qualifiers will be:
- HCMS STEM Qualifier on January 14 at Hampton Cove Middle School in Owens Cross Roads, AL
- UAH Society of Women Engineers Qualifier on January 21 at UAH in Huntsville, AL
- Port City Qualifier on January 21 at Causey Middle School in Mobile, AL
- Gigawatts Qualifier on January 28 at Fort Payne High School in Fort Payne, AL

As a reminder, each team will participate in **exactly one** qualifier. During preferencing, you will rank the four events in your preferred order. At the end of the preferencing period, we will place teams, trying to maximize first choices, as space allows. The qualifier registration fee is \$100 per team and will be due **after** assignments are issued. We will have more information after preferencing begins.


## SPIKE Guided Mission

We are excited to share that the Guided Mission has been updated in the SPIKE App for the 2022-2023 season, SUPERPOWERED<sup>SM</sup>. To update yours, open the SPIKE App to the PRIME section. On the Units section (to view the Unit Plans), go to the Competition Ready Unit Plan. If you haven't downloaded it yet, download it - this should give you the latest version. If you've already downloaded it, you should see a link to update the plan near the top of the page. The name of the lesson is "The Guided Mission 2022-23."


## Office Hours Schedule

Due to some upcoming scheduling conflicts, we will be moving office hours to every other **Tuesday** from 5 PM to 6 PM. For the month of October, this means we will offer Office Hours on October 11 and October 25.

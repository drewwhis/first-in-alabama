Hello teams, and welcome to *FIRST*<sup>&reg;</sup> LEGO<sup>&reg;</sup> League SUPERPOWERED<sup>SM</sup>!

## Season Launch Resources

If you missed the season launch video, you can find it [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V1MCpk4ucCQ). We also have a lot of handy links aggregated in [our local wiki](https://github.com/drewwhis/first-in-alabama/wiki/Useful-Links).

We also have a series of deeper dive videos in our [SUPERPOWERED Alabama Region Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLgAFQNEo9Gn8VlI7LCFeZVyb5MkcOcGDE). More videos will be added as the season goes on!

You can find many of the important links for the season:
- [Here](https://info.firstinspires.org/class-pack/firstlegoleaguediscover) for Discover,
- [Here](https://www.firstinspires.org/resource-library/fll/explore/challenge-and-resources) for Explore, or
- [Here](https://www.firstinspires.org/resource-library/fll/challenge/challenge-and-resources) for Challenge

Don't forget, on Saturday, August 13, 2022, we will be hosting an Alabama kickoff event from 9 AM to 12 NOON Central Daylight Time. The event will be held at the University of Alabama in Huntsville and will be hosted by the university's chapter of the Society of Women Engineers (SWE). The event will be in the Shelby Center (301 Sparkman Drive, Huntsville, AL 35899). Be aware that this is the address **of the whole university**, not the specific building. We have included a map (at the end of this message) for your convenience. We are currently looking at options to stream/record the event, and we should have a link for you next week. While we expect this event to be largely geared toward FLL Challenge, we welcome FLL Explore and Discover folks to join as well!

The agenda is:
- 9:00 - 9:30 AM Team Check-In (Lobby)
- 9:30 - 10:00 AM Season Launch Viewing (Room 107)
- 10:00 - 10:30 AM Energy Expert Panel (Room 107)
- 10:30 - 11:15 AM Judging and Robot Game Overviews (Room 107)
- 11:15 - 12:00 NOON Team Social Activities (Lobby)

## *FIRST* in Alabama Discord Server

We have a Discord server for all *FIRST* teams in Alabama across the entire progression of programs. Membership is extended to coaches, mentors, parents, and students. As with any Internet account, members must be at least 13 years old to sign up for a Discord account.

Here, you can directly message with *FIRST* staff and field representatives, as well as with other coaches. We also tend to make big announcements and share links in the Discord prior to a regularly scheduled email.

To join the server, use [this link](https://discord.gg/XfurbWERQ8). Once you're in, you can view each program's channel (`frc`, `ftc`, `fll-discover`, `fll-explore`, `fll-challenge`), as well as the `volunteer` channel.

You can learn more about using Discord [here](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360045138571-Beginner-s-Guide-to-Discord).

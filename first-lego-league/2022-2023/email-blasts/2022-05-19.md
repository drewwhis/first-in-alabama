Hello teams!

Welcome to the 2022-2023 season [*FIRST*<sup>&reg;</sup> ENERGIZE<sup>SM</sup> presented by Qualcomm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-qwsMmkFwg) and *FIRST*<sup>&reg;</sup> LEGO<sup>&reg;</sup> League [SUPERPOWERED<sup>SM</sup>](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okR1AMFNV3Q). Today marks the official launch of the new *FIRST* season!

As of today, you can log into your [*FIRST* Dashboard](https://my.firstinspires.org/Dashboard/) to update your personal and team information. This is a great time to agree to the annual policies, complete Youth Protection Policy (YPP) screening if yours has expired, create new teams, and mark existing teams as returning. See our pages on registering an [Existing Team](https://github.com/drewwhis/first-in-alabama/wiki/Register-an-EXISTING-Team) or a [New Team](https://github.com/drewwhis/first-in-alabama/wiki/Adding-a-NEW-Team) for more information.


## Payment Updates

For the new season, there are some pricing and policy changes at *FIRST*, so make sure you're aware! You can learn more about current pricing structure on our wiki for [Challenge](https://github.com/drewwhis/first-in-alabama/wiki/Challenge), [Explore](https://github.com/drewwhis/first-in-alabama/wiki/Explore), and [Discover](https://github.com/drewwhis/first-in-alabama/wiki/Discover).

As part of the new policies, *FIRST* will no longer be able to replace original payments with other funding after orders are complete. Once check out is complete, the order and payment method are final. Before completing the purchase, teams should ensure they have received and applied all anticipated grant funding and, if applicable, uploaded their Sales Tax Exemption Certificate. Unused funds at the end of the 2022-2023 season will be returned to the original grantor/sponsor. Teams should coordinate with their sponsors to allocate and utilize the teamâ€™s funding with this in mind. 

**If you are tax exempt, you must upload your documentation before you pay for your registration or products**.

Please let us know if you have any questions about the new policies!


## SPIKE Software Updates

Now's a good time to update your SPIKE software on your devices and your brick firmware. To download the SPIKE Software, visit [LEGO Education](https://education.lego.com/en-us/downloads/spike-app/software). You have multiple options, but we recommend choosing your operating system (the website should do this by default) and then selecting **Get The App**, which will take you through the Windows Store, App Store, or Google Play.

Note that you may instead select the **Download** option which will provide you with a traditional download. As of this writing, the latest version is 2.0.6.

Once you have the latest version and connect your brick, you should be prompted if you have any firmware updates to apply.

You'll also notice an option to **Launch Web App**. This is a new, **beta** version of the software that runs on a Chrome browser and **requires an Internet connection**. While this version is handy for quick setup and testing, please keep in mind that **there is no guarantee** you'll have Internet access at events. We **strongly recommend** you have a device with the SPIKE software installed, especially when preparing your competition/event robot(s).


## Office Hours

For this season, we'll be launching office hours! These will be one-hour virtual sessions offered twice weekly where coaches can drop in and ask questions about any number of *FIRST* or *FIRST* LEGO League topics! The sessions will not be recorded, but we will make sure to share any noteworthy developments that come out of them.

The sessions will be hosted by Drew Whisenant, Alabama *FIRST* LEGO League Challenge Judge Advisor, and other key personnel will be invited (though their attendance isn't guaranteed), including:
- Taylor Whisenant, Alabama *FIRST* LEGO League Program Delivery Partner
- Jamie McClung, Alabama *FIRST* Senior Mentor
- Others!

If a topic comes up that one of our key personnel would be more suited to answer, we'll make sure to direct it to them! The current plan is to offer sessions:
- Tuesdays from 3 PM to 4 PM
- Thursdays from 6 PM to 7 PM

In the next email, we will announce when the office hours will officially start as well as how to participate. If you have questions before then, feel free to reach out!


## Where To Find Things

The season-specific materials will release on **August 2, 2022** on the *FIRST* LEGO League YouTube channel, and we'll provide more information as the date approaches.

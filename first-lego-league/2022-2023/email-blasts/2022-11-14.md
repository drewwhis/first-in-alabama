Hello teams!

With the Thanksgiving holiday approaching and the webinar for Challenge teams this week, there will be **no email** next week, nor will there be **no office hours** next week.


## Challenge Qualifiers

Earlier this evening, we sent messages to teams with information about their specific qualifier events. If you're missing that message, please follow-up with us ASAP. As a reminder, if you are in need of an invoice or a copy of the *FIRST* in Alabama W-9, please contact us.

To help teams prepare for their qualifiers, we will be hosting a webinar **this week** on **Wednesday, November 16** from 6 PM to 7 PM to discuss what to expect at a qualifier, and answer questions! The session will be recorded and posted on our YouTube channel for those unable to attend.

Speakers include:
- Taylor Whisenant, *FIRST*<sup>&reg;</sup> LEGO<sup>&reg;</sup> League Program Delivery Partner for Alabama
- Jamie McClung, *FIRST* Senior Mentor and Veteran *FIRST* LEGO League Challenge Coach
- Chris Bero, *FIRST* LEGO League Challenge Head Referee for Alabama
- Drew Whisenant, *FIRST* LEGO League Challenge Judge Advisor for Alabama

You can join the meeting using [this link](). If you won't be able to attend and have questions you think other teams could benefit from hearing, please send those in advance so we can answer them during the session.

If your team missed the preferencing window and would like to sign up for a qualifier, please contact us ASAP as we have extremely limited space available.

Our *FIRST* LEGO League Challenge qualifiers aren't the only *FIRST* events happening during the *FIRST* ENERGIZE season! We have a whole slate of events listed in our Save the Date below. As a reminder, all *FIRST* events are free to attend and open to the public.

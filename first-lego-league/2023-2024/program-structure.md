# *FIRST*<sup>&reg;</sup> LEGO<sup>&reg;</sup> League

Starting with the 2020-2021 season, there have been some structural changes to our program. If you were familiar with *FIRST*<sup>&reg;</sup> LEGO<sup>&reg;</sup> League, *FIRST*<sup>&reg;</sup> LEGO<sup>&reg;</sup> League Jr., or *FIRST*<sup>&reg;</sup> LEGO<sup>&reg;</sup> League Jr. Discovery Edition in past seasons, these programs are now all under the *FIRST* LEGO League umbrella as one unified program with three divisions.

Some highlights are captured here for easy reference. You can refer to the [*FIRST*<sup>&reg;</sup> website](https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/fll) for more information.

If you have any questions about any of the material, including participation, fees, and Class Pack vs. Traditional Teams, please reach out to your Program Delivery Partners.


## Challenge

### Summary

Friendly competition is at the heart of Challenge, as teams of students engage in research, problem-solving, coding, and engineering - building and programming a LEGO<sup>&reg;</sup> robot that navigates the missions of a robot game. This division is targeted towards students in Fourth through Eighth Grade. This division was previously known as *FIRST* LEGO League.


### Participation

There are two ways to participate in *FIRST* LEGO League Challenge: Traditional Teams and Class Pack.

A *FIRST* LEGO League Challenge Traditional Team requires two Coach/Mentors aged 18 or older. These two coaches must be registered with the team in the [*FIRST* Dashboard](https://my.firstinspires.org/Dashboard/), and each Coach/Mentor may be associated with any number of *FIRST* teams. Optionally, the team may also have a Team Administrator. Each team must have at least two team members. Members must be **either** between the ages of nine and 14 **or** in grades 4th through 8th; it is **not** required that a student meet both the age and grade requirement - only one is required. The ages and grades are effective **at the time the student is added to the team** in the *FIRST* Dashboard. No team may include more than 10 total members - this includes any members who act on a part-time basis, so the limit is 10 **unique people** rather than "10 simultaneous members." Students may **not** participate on more than one *FIRST* LEGO League Challenge Traditional Team. Traditional teams are eligible to participate in official *FIRST* LEGO League Challenge competitions in the Alabama region.

Class Pack is a curricular approach to *FIRST* LEGO League Challenge, whereby a school, organization, or other group may purchase materials to serve content to students in groups of up to 24 per unit. Class Pack groups are **not** eligible for *FIRST* LEGO League Challenge competitions in the Alabama region. Class Pack may be used in conjunction with Traditional Teams, though. For example, a school may wish to purchase two Class Packs to serve 48 students on eight teams and one or more Traditional Team registrations. The school could then have an internal competition to determine which team or teams would compete in the Alabama region. Each Class Pack purchase grants eligibility for a discounted Traditional Team rookie team registration.

This division is targeted towards students in **Second through Fourth Grade**. This division was previously known as *FIRST* LEGO League Jr.


### Participation

There are two ways to participate in *FIRST* LEGO League Explore: Traditional Teams and Class Pack.

The ages and grades are effective **at the time the student is added to the team** in the *FIRST* Dashboard. No team may include more than six total members - this includes any members who act on a part-time basis, so the limit is six **unique people** rather than "six simultaneous members." Students may not participate on more than one *FIRST* LEGO League Explore Traditional Team. The ages are effective **at the time the student joins the team**. Traditional teams are eligible to participate in official *FIRST* LEGO League Explore Festival events in the Alabama region. Unlike Challenge, Explore is **non-competitive**, and teams are celebrated for their hard work and growth at Festival events.

Class Pack is a curricular approach to *FIRST* LEGO League Explore, whereby a school, organization, or other group may purchase materials to serve content to students in groups of up to 24 per unit. Class Pack groups are **not** eligible for *FIRST* LEGO League Explore Festival events in the Alabama region. Class Pack may be used in conjunction with Traditional Teams, though.

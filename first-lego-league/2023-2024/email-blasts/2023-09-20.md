Hello teams!

We haven't had an email blast in a few weeks because we haven't had much information to share, but we do now!

## Events - Challenge and Explore

We have dates and locations to share for all of our expected qualifiers based on current projections:
- November 4th - UAH Society of Women Engineers Qualifier at UAH in Huntsville
- November 11th - Port City Qualifier at Causey Middle School in Mobile
- November 11th - AAA Qualifier at the Academy for Academics and Arts in Huntsville
- November 18th - HCMS STEM Qualifier at Hampton Cove Middle School in Owens Cross Roads

We will start the preferencing process on **Monday, September 25**. We will close preferencing on **Friday, September 29** so we can assign teams **no later than October 1**.

Please be aware that, generally, we **cannot promise specific events to specific teams**. We try to maximize top choices. Teams that do not complete preferencing will be assigned to whichever events have space available after we assign teams who complete preferencing.

If you have questions about the process, please reach out.

Following our qualifiers, some Challenge teams will advance from their qualifiers to the Alabama Championship! The Alabama Championship will be held on Saturday, January 27, 2024, at Hampton Cove Middle School, in Owens Cross Roads, AL. 

Finally, all Explore teams will be invited to the Alabama Festival on Saturday, April 6, 2024, at the von Braun Center in Huntsville, AL. This event takes place as part of the *FIRST*<sup>&reg;</sup> Robotics Competition Rocket City Regional Event. We will send out registration information for this event after the start of the year.


## Express Enrollment - Youth Registration

All youths should be registered with their teams through *FIRST*. This season, a new application called Express Enrollment has been launched, offering parents a quick (around two minutes) path to registering their children with your team!

[Instructions for Coaches](https://www.firstinspires.org/sites/default/files/uploads/resource_library/express-enrollment-youth-registration-mentors.pdf) are available, as are [Instructions for Parents](https://www.firstinspires.org/sites/default/files/uploads/resource_library/express-enrollment-youth-registration-parents.pdf). You can also refer to the [Express Enrollment FAQ](https://www.firstinspires.org/sites/default/files/uploads/resource_library/express-enrollment-youth-registration-faq.pdf) if you have questions.

If you have gone through this process in the past, you should find this new experience much improved!


## Weekly Office Hours

Office hours are an opportunity for coaches to call in with questions about anything relating to *FIRST*<sup>&reg;</sup> or *FIRST* LEGO League. While we expect most questions will come from our Challenge folks, these sessions are open to all three levels - Challenge, Explore, and Discover!

We are moving the sessions to **Wednesdays** from 4:30 PM to 5:30 PM. All times are Central. The sessions will be hosted in Google Meet at https://meet.google.com/mso-yhrn-brp. If you prefer to dial in, you can call +1 315-599-0319 and enter the PIN 174 515 123#.

Hello teams!

## Challenge Qualifiers and Special Office Hours

Our Qualifiers for Challenge teams will be starting in just a few weeks. We will be hosting a *special* office hours session on Wednesday, October 25 from 6:00 PM to 7:00 PM (Central). This session will be recorded and will feature some overviews of what to expect at a qualifier - including the review of some of the key documents listed above. This session will be hosted in Google Meet at https://meet.google.com/mso-yhrn-brp. If you prefer to dial in, you can call +1 315-599-0319 and enter the PIN 174 515 123#. Feel free to come with questions or just listen in!

## STEAM Fest 2023

STEAM Fest is rapidly approaching on October 28th, 2023, at the von Braun Center in Huntsville! We are looking for teams to bring their robot and/or presentation materials to demonstrate the full progression of *FIRST* programs. Information on this event can be found on the [von Braun Center's website](https://www.vonbrauncenter.com/event/steamfest-2023/7010/).

To sign up for this event please send Anna Strutzenberg, the *FIRST* Tech Challenge Program Delivery Partner for Alabama, an email. Her email address is [astrutzenberg@firstpartners.org](mailto:astrutzenberg@firstpartners.org). Please include as the subject line `FLL Challenge Team# STEAM Fest Sign Up` or `FLL Explore Team# STEAM Fest Sign Up`, depending on your program, where `Team#` is your team's number in the *FIRST* Dashboard. She will send out a link for you to request a time to demo. If you do not want to be put into a time slot and want to come for the entire time OR have a specific slot that you need, please let her know in your email. 


## *FIRST* Volunteer Opportunities

Did you know there are two other *FIRST* programs that your students can be involved in after they age out of *FIRST* LEGO League? *FIRST* Robotics Competition (FRC) is aimed at students in grades 9-12, and *FIRST* Tech Challenge (FTC) is intended for students in grades 7-12.

The *FIRST* Tech Challenge season has begun and competition season is about to start. If you are curious about what a next step for your student could look like, we invite you to volunteer or spectate at our upcoming competitions. One of the best ways to get a peek into the FTC world is by volunteering as a judge. This will get you up-close and personal with teams and robots to show you what you can expect in the next level. 

Why Judge at an FTC Competition?
- Inspire Transition: Share your FLL experience to motivate FTC teams.
- Expand Knowledge: Gain insights into advanced robotics and innovative problem-solving.
- Networking: Connect with like-minded individuals, expanding your *FIRST* community network.
- Mentorship: Offer valuable feedback to FTC teams, helping them thrive.

If you are interested in volunteering, please contact [astrutzenberg@firstpartners.org](mailto:astrutzenberg@firstpartners.org). All *FIRST* events are free and open to the public - even if you are unable to volunteer, we would love to see you and your team come check out FTC!

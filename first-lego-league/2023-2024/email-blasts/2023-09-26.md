Hello teams!

Challenge Event Preferencing is well underway, and we look forward to sharing placements with teams as soon as the process concludes!

## Event Preferencing

We sent the preferencing form for qualifiers to our Challenge teams on Monday. Preferencing will be open until 5:00 PM on Friday, September 29. Teams that do not complete the preferencing process will be assigned to qualifiers with open capacity. As a reminder, we will attempt to maximize first preferences, but, generally, we do not guarantee and specific event to any specific team.

If your Challenge team did not receive the preferencing form or if you have a team that was missing from the preferencing form, please let us know ASAP **with your TEAM NUMBER**. We are unable to resolve issues without your team number, so please include this information for quickest resolution.

Teams preparing for qualifiers may find these documents helpful:

As a reminder, this process is only for our Challenge teams. We will have event registration for our Explore teams sometime in January 2024.

## Express Enrollment - Youth Registration

All youths should be registered with their teams through *FIRST*. This season, a new application called Express Enrollment has been launched, offering parents a quick (around two minutes) path to registering their children with your team!

[Instructions for Coaches](https://www.firstinspires.org/sites/default/files/uploads/resource_library/express-enrollment-youth-registration-mentors.pdf) are available, as are [Instructions for Parents](https://www.firstinspires.org/sites/default/files/uploads/resource_library/express-enrollment-youth-registration-parents.pdf). You can also refer to the [Express Enrollment FAQ](https://www.firstinspires.org/sites/default/files/uploads/resource_library/express-enrollment-youth-registration-faq.pdf) if you have questions.

If you have gone through this process in the past, you should find this new experience much improved!


## Weekly Office Hours

Office hours are an opportunity for coaches to call in with questions about anything relating to *FIRST*<sup>&reg;</sup> or *FIRST* LEGO League. While we expect most questions will come from our Challenge folks, these sessions are open to all three levels - Challenge, Explore, and Discover!

We are moving the sessions to **Wednesdays** from 4:30 PM to 5:30 PM. All times are Central. The sessions will be hosted in Google Meet at https://meet.google.com/mso-yhrn-brp. If you prefer to dial in, you can call +1 315-599-0319 and enter the PIN 174 515 123#.

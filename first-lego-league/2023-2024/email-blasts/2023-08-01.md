Hello teams, and welcome to *FIRST*<sup>&reg;</sup> LEGO<sup>&reg;</sup> League MASTERPIECE<sup>SM</sup>!

## Season Launch Resources

If you missed the season launch video, you can find it [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exjYBYYGIPE). We also have a lot of handy links aggregated in [our local wiki](https://github.com/drewwhis/first-in-alabama/wiki/Useful-Links).

We also have a series of deeper dive videos in our [MASTERPIECE Alabama Region Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLgAFQNEo9Gn_moKwxdT2f_dnnvQp0Q78A) for the Challenge Division. More videos may be added as the season goes on!

You can find many of the important links for the season:
- [Here](https://info.firstinspires.org/class-pack/firstlegoleaguediscover) for Discover,
- [Here](https://www.firstinspires.org/resource-library/fll/explore/challenge-and-resources) for Explore, or
- [Here](https://www.firstinspires.org/resource-library/fll/challenge/challenge-and-resources) for Challenge

We are still trying to plan a kickoff event for teams to attend, and we will share information as it becomes available.


## Weekly Office Hours

We will continue office hours this season! Office hours are an opportunity for coaches to call in with questions about anything relating to *FIRST*<sup>&reg;</sup> or *FIRST* LEGO League. While we expect most questions will come from our Challenge folks, these sessions are open to all three levels - Challenge, Explore, and Discover!

The current plan is to offer sessions on **Tuesdays** from 4:30 PM to 5:30 PM. All times are Central. The sessions will be hosted in Google Meet at https://meet.google.com/mso-yhrn-brp. If you prefer to dial in, you can call +1 315-599-0319 and enter the PIN 174 515 123#.


## Robotics Day at Joe Davis Stadium

On Sunday, August 6 from 3 PM to 6 PM, *FIRST*<sup>&reg;</sup> in Alabama teams are invited to showcase their work from the past year at Joe Davis Stadium in Huntsville, AL. If you are interested in participating, please contact Anna Strutzenberg, the *FIRST*<sup>&reg;</sup> Tech Challenge Program Delivery Partner for Alabama, at <a href="mailto:astrutzenberg@firstpartners.org">astrutzenberg@firstpartners.org</a>.


## *FIRST* in Alabama Discord Server

We have a Discord server for all *FIRST* teams in Alabama across the entire progression of programs. Membership is extended to coaches, mentors, parents, and students. As with any Internet account, members must be at least 13 years old to sign up for a Discord account.

Here, you can directly message with *FIRST* staff and field representatives, as well as with other coaches. We also tend to make big announcements and share links in the Discord prior to a regularly scheduled email.

To join the server, use [this link](https://discord.gg/XfurbWERQ8). Once you're in, you can view each program's channel (`frc`, `ftc`, `fll-discover`, `fll-explore`, `fll-challenge`), as well as the `volunteer` channel.

You can learn more about using Discord [here](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360045138571-Beginner-s-Guide-to-Discord).

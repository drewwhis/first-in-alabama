We will be hosting a *special* office hours session on Wednesday, October 25 from 6:00 PM to 7:00 PM (Central). This session will be recorded and will feature some overviews of what to expect at a qualifier - including the review of some of the key documents listed above.

Feel free to come with questions or just listen in!


## STEAM Fest 2023

STEAM Fest is rapidly approaching on October 28th, 2023, at the von Braun Center in Huntsville! We are looking for teams to bring their robot and/or presentation materials to demonstrate the full progression of *FIRST* programs. Information on this event can be found on the [von Braun Center's website](https://www.vonbrauncenter.com/event/steamfest-2023/7010/).

To sign up for this event please send Anna Strutzenberg, the *FIRST* Tech Challenge Program Delivery Partner for Alabama, an email. Her email address is [astrutzenberg@firstpartners.org](mailto:astrutzenberg@firstpartners.org). Please include as the subject line `FLL Challenge Team# STEAM Fest Sign Up` or `FLL Explore Team# STEAM Fest Sign Up`, depending on your program, where `Team#` is your team's number in the *FIRST* Dashboard. She will send out a link for you to request a time to demo. If you do not want to be put into a time slot and want to come for the entire time OR have a specific slot that you need, please let her know in your email. 


## Express Enrollment - Youth Registration

All youths should be registered with their teams through *FIRST*. This season, a new application called Express Enrollment has been launched, offering parents a quick (around two minutes) path to registering their children with your team!

[Instructions for Coaches](https://www.firstinspires.org/sites/default/files/uploads/resource_library/express-enrollment-youth-registration-mentors.pdf) are available, as are [Instructions for Parents](https://www.firstinspires.org/sites/default/files/uploads/resource_library/express-enrollment-youth-registration-parents.pdf). You can also refer to the [Express Enrollment FAQ](https://www.firstinspires.org/sites/default/files/uploads/resource_library/express-enrollment-youth-registration-faq.pdf) if you have questions.

If you have gone through this process in the past, you should find this new experience much improved! In summary, the workflow is:
1. Coaches create invitation links/QR codes to share with parents (from the [Dashboard](https://my.firstinspires.org/Dashboard/))
2. Parents use the links/QR codes to apply their youths to the team through the Express Enrollment portal
3. Coaches can accept or decline applications from their [Dashboard](https://my.firstinspires.org/Dashboard/) by clicking on the `Youth Members` link for the team

Please refer to the documentation provided for additional information.

# *FIRST*&reg; LEGO&reg; League

Starting with the 2020-2021 season, there have been some structural changes to our program. If you were familiar with *FIRST*&reg; LEGO&reg; League, *FIRST*&reg; LEGO&reg; League Jr., or *FIRST*&reg; LEGO&reg; League Jr. Discovery Edition in past seasons, these programs are now all under the *FIRST*&reg; LEGO&reg; League umbrella as one unified program with three divisions.

Some highlights are captured here for easy reference. You can refer to the [*FIRST*&reg; website](https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/fll) for more information.

If you have any questions about any of the material, including participation, fees, and Class Pack vs. Traditional Teams, please reach out to your Program Delivery Partners.

## Challenge

### Summary

Friendly competition is at the heart of Challenge, as teams of students ages 9-14 engage in research, problem-solving, coding, and engineering - building and programming a LEGO robot that navigates the missions of a robot game. This division is targeted towards students in **Fourth through Eighth Grade**. This division was previously known as *FIRST*&reg; LEGO&reg; League.


### Participation

There are two ways to participate in *FIRST*&reg; LEGO&reg; League Challenge: Traditional Teams and Class Pack.

A *FIRST*&reg; LEGO&reg; League Challenge Traditional Team requires two Coach/Mentors aged 18 or older. These two coaches must be registered with the team in the [*FIRST*&reg; Dashboard](https://www.firstinspires.org), and each Coach/Mentor may be associated with any number of *FIRST*&reg; teams. Optionally, the team may also have a Team Administrator. Each team must have at least two team members between the ages of nine and 14 and no more than 10 total members. This includes any members who act on a part-time basis, so the limit is effectively "10 bodies," rather than "10 full students." Students may not participate on more than one *FIRST*&reg; LEGO&reg; League Challenge Traditional Team. The ages are effective at the start of the calendar year, so a student who is 15 on January 1, 2021 may **not** participate, but a student who turned 15 on January 2, 2021 is eligible. Students younger than nine may also participate at the discretion of the team's coaches. Traditional teams are eligible to participate in official *FIRST*&reg; LEGO&reg; League Challenge competitions in the Alabama region.

Class Pack is a curricular approach to *FIRST*&reg; LEGO&reg; League Challenge, whereby a school, organization, or other group may purchase materials to serve content to students in groups of up to 24 per unit. Class Pack groups are **not** eligible for *FIRST*&reg; LEGO&reg; League Challenge competitions in the Alabama region. Class Pack may be used in conjunction with Traditional Teams, though. For example, a school may wish to purchase two Class Packs to serve 48 students on eight teams and one or more Traditional Team registrations. The school could then have an internal competition to determine which team or teams would compete in the Alabama region. Each Class Pack purchase grants eligibility for a discounted Traditional Team rookie team registration.

## Explore

### Summary

In Explore, teams of students ages 6-10 focus on the fundamentals of engineering as they explore real-world problems, learn to design, and code and create unique solutions made with LEGO&reg; bricks and powered by LEGO&reg; Education WeDo 2.0. This division is targeted towards students in **Second through Fourth Grade**. This division was previously known as *FIRST*&reg; LEGO&reg; League Jr.


### Participation

There are two ways to participate in *FIRST*&reg; LEGO&reg; League Explore: Traditional Teams and Class Pack.

A *FIRST*&reg; LEGO&reg; League Explore Traditional Team requires two Coach/Mentors aged 18 or older. These two coaches must be registered with the team in the [*FIRST*&reg; Dashboard](https://www.firstinspires.org), and each Coach/Mentor may be associated with any number of *FIRST*&reg; teams. Optionally, the team may also have a Team Administrator. Each team must have at least two team members between the ages of six and 10 and no more than six total members. This includes any members who act on a part-time basis, so the limit is effectively "six bodies," rather than "six full students." Students may not participate on more than one *FIRST*&reg; LEGO&reg; League Explore Traditional Team. The ages are effective at the start of the calendar year, so a student who is 11 on January 1, 2021 may **not** participate, but a student who turned 11 on January 2, 2021 is eligible. Students younger than six may also participate at the discretion of the team's coaches. Traditional teams are eligible to participate in official *FIRST*&reg; LEGO&reg; League Explore Festival events in the Alabama region. Unlike Challenge, Explore is **non-competitive**, and teams are celebrated for their hard work and growth at Festival events.

Class Pack is a curricular approach to *FIRST*&reg; LEGO&reg; League Explore, whereby a school, organization, or other group may purchase materials to serve content to students in groups of up to 24 per unit. Class Pack groups are **not** eligible for *FIRST*&reg; LEGO&reg; League Explore Festival events in the Alabama region. Class Pack may be used in conjunction with Traditional Teams, though. For example, a school may wish to purchase two Class Packs to serve 48 students on 14 teams and one or more Traditional Team registrations. The school could then have an internal Festival to determine which team or teams would participate in the Alabama region Festivals. Each Class Pack purchase grants eligibility for a discounted Traditional Team rookie team registration.

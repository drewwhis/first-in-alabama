Hello teams!

We're now two weeks into our webinar series for Challenge coaches. As a reminder, all recordings will be available on [this YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLgAFQNEo9Gn9aLBNm1BQX_8BHWpx40vLS).


## *FIRST*&reg; Impact Reports

Many of us have seen first-hand the positive impact that *FIRST*&reg; experiences have on our students, and we have some quantitative data to share with you! These documents are publicly available, so feel free to share them as you like with parents of prospective team members, school/organizational administrators, and your community!

Our first impact brief illustrates positive [STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) Engagement and Outcomes](https://www.firstinspires.org/sites/default/files/uploads/resource_library/impact/stem-boosting-engagement.pdf) for students - one highlight being that *FIRST*&reg; students are two times more likely to show an increase in STEM-related attitudes and interests (than comparison group peers).

Our second illustrates [*FIRST*&reg;'s Lasting Impact on Girls and Young Women](https://www.firstinspires.org/sites/default/files/uploads/resource_library/impact/lasting-impact-females.pdf), with female *FIRST*&reg; alumni/ae being more likely to declare a major in engineering or computer science (at 51% over 16% of the comparison group)!

## Challenge Webinar - This Week (Challenge Only)

Our next webinar, scheduled for Thursday, September 16, at 6:30 PM will be our [CARGO CONNECT Table Q&A](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/168444910261). We'll be taking your questions about the Robot Game Rules and Missions! We strongly encourage you to read over the [Robot Game Rules](https://firstinspiresst01.blob.core.windows.net/first-forward/fll-challenge/fll-challenge-cargo-connect-robot-game-rulebook.pdf) and the [Challenge Updates](https://firstinspiresst01.blob.core.windows.net/first-forward/fll-challenge/fll-challenge-cargo-connect-challenge-updates.pdf) before the session. We also recommend watching our [CARGO CONNECT playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eE9UZNM0Oss&list=PLgAFQNEo9Gn9sJS5w91z1FvumnuAOneEa).

We'll take questions as long as we have participants - otherwise it may just be 30 minutes to an hour of Jamie and Drew talking to each other about the models and missions.

## Amazon Future Engineer Class Chats

Amazon has partnered with *FIRST*&reg; LEGO&reg; League and is delivering two currently scheduled webinars! These are great opportunities to develop your Innovation Project for FLL Challenge or to learn more about transportation for FLL Explore.

In partnership with *FIRST*&reg; LEGO&reg; League, Amazon welcomes you to an Amazon Transportation 101 panel. Students will learn how Amazon delivers packages all the way to their doorstep. They’ll meet experts from each part of Amazon's transportation process (“First, Middle and Last Mile") and discover what each speaker and their team do each day to make sure customer orders are delivered safely and correctly. Sign up today for the [Future of Transportation: Amazon Transportation 101](https://register.gotowebinar.com/register/3797739968042103822).

Amazon utilizes its extensive transportation and delivery network to do good through programs like Disaster Relief, Community Delivery, and more! Students will get to meet 3-4 Amazonians who lead work to help communities by leveraging Amazon’s transportation networks. Each speaker will present who they are, what they do, and a bit about the logistics that enable them to do good with transportation. Sign up today for the [Future of Transportation: Transportation for Good](https://register.gotowebinar.com/register/4541128575674601998).

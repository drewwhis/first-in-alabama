Hello teams!

We know the winter break is fast approaching, so we hope everything is going well!

## Qualifiers (Challenge Only)

At this point, we've assigned all Challenge teams who completed registration to their qualifiers. We're ironing out a few minor issues over the next couple of days, but for the most part, we don't expect anything to change. The qualifier fee is \$100 per team. This is payable to *FIRST*&reg; in Alabama, **not** *FIRST*&reg;, and can be paid by mail or turned in at your event. If you would like to mail your qualifier payment prior to your event, the address is

    FIRST in Alabama
    REDACTED
    REDACTED
    REDACTED

We have also attached the *FIRST*&reg; in Alabama W-9 for your reference. If you need an invoice, please email Taylor (twhisenant@firstinalabama.org) with your request.

We have added the qualifier preparation webinar to our [playlist on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLgAFQNEo9Gn9aLBNm1BQX_8BHWpx40vLS) for anyone who missed it this past weekend. Make sure to check out the other videos if you missed them!

We expect more information about your specific qualifier to go out starting **next week**, so be on the lookout for that. As a reminder, our qualifier names and locations are below:
- The Southern Railway Qualifier on January 29 at Fort Payne Middle School (4910 Martin Avenue NE, Fort Payne, AL 35967)
- The HSV Qualifier on February 5 at Hampton Cove Middle School (261-B Old Highway 431, Owens Cross Roads, AL 35763)
- The Port City Qualifier on February 5 at Causey Middle School (2205 McFarland Road, Mobile, AL 36695)


## Remote Scrimmage (Challenge Only)

Between now and January 15, 2022, teams **registered for a qualifier** will be able to submit two videos for review in a remote scrimmage. The first video will just be you giving us an overview of your table setup and showing how your models work; this will let you make sure you're following the correct build instructions and setting up the table prior to matches correctly. The second video will be your team conducting a full 2.5 minute match just like they would at competition; this video will also require you to record (close-up!) the models on the table when the match is over so we can calculate a score.

This is an optional activity for teams, and we will provide feedback on a rolling basis - the earlier you submit videos, the earlier you'll get feedback! We'll have submission information next week, and *FIRST*&reg; provided [some recording guidelines](https://firstinspiresst01.blob.core.windows.net/first-game-changers/fll-challenge/robot-game-video-recording-doc.pdf) last season that should help!

You can submit your entry [on our Google Form](https://forms.gle/QcC2bqFbgZdiw2QK9). Please let us know if you have any questions or issues!


## Robot Kits

As a reminder, there are two SPIKE systems available from LEGO&reg; now. The SPIKE Essential is intended for FLL **Explore** teams, while the SPIKE Prime is intended for **Challenge** teams. You can mix-and-match parts between the systems without any issue! Just make sure if you are a **Challenge** team that you are using the **brick** from the SPIKE **Prime** system. The brick for the SPIKE Essential is much smaller (two ports vs. six) and would put you at a severe technical disadvantage in the *FIRST*&reg; LEGO&reg; League Challenge program.

Hello teams!

If you're like me, you're probably counting down the days until Season Launch! Don't forget to tune in on August 17 at 12:00 PM EDT (that's 11:00 AM Central Daylight Time).


## TVA Registration Grants

We were notified today that TVA grants will be available soon for teams in the TVA service area. We don't have any additional information at this time, but we will include the information in the next weekly email when we have it to share! We will also share the information in the *FIRST*&reg; in Alabama Discord as soon as we know, so make sure to sign up to be notified immediately!


## BAE Systems Grant

Challenge and Explore teams are eligible for the BAE Systems Grant, with no restriction on applicants. Preference, however, will be given to these groups:
- Teams located within 70 miles of a BAE Systems site
- Teams with BAE Systems mentors
- Teams with an existing relationship with BAE Systems
- Teams demonstrating diversity in STEM

You can apply for the grant [here](https://www.baesystems.com/en-us/our-company/about-us/bae-systems-inc/community-investment/first-robotics-grants).


## Discover Grants

*FIRST*&reg; LEGO&reg; League Discover is the offering for students in grades Pre-K through 1.

The LEGO&reg; Foundation is supporting *FIRST*&reg; LEGO&reg; League Discover this year! Grants are available that provide Discover Class Packs, STEAM Park sets, and Professional Development for sites serving primarily underrepresented and under-served students. As part of the grant, recipients must commit to purchasing their own Discover Class Packs next year.

Applications are open now and are being reviewed on a rolling basis until all available Class Packs have been awarded. Review the [Discover Grant Application Summary](https://info.firstinspires.org/hubfs/FLL_Assets/partner-blast-attachments/2021-22%20CARGO%20CONNECT/Grant%20Application%20Summary%20Discover%202021.pdf) for more information and submit your Discover Grant Application today!

Hello teams!

We are excited for the first remote qualifier this week!

## Remote Qualifiers (Challenge)

On Friday night, we sent all qualifier information to all teams who registered (for all events!). Some of you may be missing one or more emails for one or more teams - please let us know ASAP if you didn't get one (and be sure to include the team number)!

Please check your qualifier email for all important details. Also, please make sure that each round uses a different configuration for Mission 10 (there are six possible, so you only need three).

Finally, make sure all of your documents are uploaded by the deadline for your event!


## Alabama Festival (Explore)

Registration for the 2022 *FIRST*&reg; LEGO&reg; League Explore Alabama Festival is open! The event will be held on Saturday, April 9, 2022, at the von Braun Center in Huntsville, AL.

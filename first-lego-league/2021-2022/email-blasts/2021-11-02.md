Hello teams!

With the start of November comes our transition into event registration and preparation! Make sure you have everything up-to-date in your Dashboard!


## Qualifier Dates and Timeline (Challenge Only)

We are now able to share with you our qualifier locations and dates for our Challenge teams!
- Saturday, January 29, 2022, at Fort Payne Middle School (TENTATIVE) in Fort Payne, AL
- Saturday, February 5, 2022, at Hampton Cove Middle School in Owens Cross Roads, AL
- TBD at Causey Middle School in Mobile, AL

The Mobile event will be held on one of those two weekends, and we should have final word in the next week.

The Mobile event will be able to accommodate around a dozen teams while the other two events will be able to accommodate around twenty teams each. Every team is guaranteed a spot at one of these events, but we cannot promise specific events to any team, only that we can make our best attempts to maximize team preferences while considering team travel.

Here are the next steps you'll want to be aware of:
1. Only teams that have completed **team registration** with *FIRST*&reg; are eligible for events. This includes paying your team fees in the Dashboard. Team registration will officially close on **Friday, November 12, 2021**.
2. We will open event preferences to teams on **Tuesday, November 16, 2021**. At that time, we will contact **only** the person listed as **Lead Coach/Mentor 1** with registration information. You will want to make sure your team information is up-to-date in the Dashboard.
3. Event preferences will close on **Friday, December 3, 2021**, and we will notify teams of their events on **Tuesday, December 7, 2021**.
4. The **event fee** is \$100 per team, but that fee is not due until the **day of your event**. That fee is also **not** paid to *FIRST*&reg;. We will provide additional information about how payment can be arranged next week.

If you have questions, feel free to reach out, as always. We will provide more information in the weeks to come, as well.


## Student Registration Requirement

As we get closer to our events, remember that *FIRST*&reg; is requiring **all** youth team members to officially register with their teams in the online Dashboard. Now is a great time to start this process if you have not already done so!

There are detailed steps in the [Youth Registration System Overview](https://www.firstinspires.org/resource-library/youth-registration-system), and we have updated our Frequently Asked Questions pages to point to this resource.

If you have questions or issues registering your team members, you will need to contact *FIRST*&reg; HQ (rather than your local partners). They can be reached by email at firstteammembers@firstinspires.org or by phone at 800-871-8326 (Option “0”  for assistance).


## Virtual Amazon Fulfillment Center Tours

*FIRST*&reg; LEGO&reg; League teams will have the opportunity to participate in two private virtual Amazon Fulfillment Center Tours and Q&As happening on Thursday, November 4 at 4 PM CT and Tuesday, November 9 at 3 PM CT. 

A recording will be available for teams that are not able to attend the live virtual events. To register for the event, use [this link](https://register.gotowebinar.com/rt/6275823673488020496).

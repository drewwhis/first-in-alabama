Hello teams!

We've reached the end of August, and we're diving head-first into the CARGO CONNECT season!


## Youth Protection Screening

If you or your partner coach have not completed Youth Protection Screening (required every four years), be on the lookout for an email from *FIRST*&reg;. All coaches and volunteers must be compliant with the Youth Protection Policy.

We have some information available [on our wiki](https://github.com/drewwhis/first-in-alabama/wiki/Complete-Youth-Protection-Policy-Screening) if you think you need to update your screening, but feel free to reach out if you have any questions!


## SPIKE Essential Sweepstakes (Explore Only)

Build curiosity and STEM skills on your *FIRST*&reg; LEGO&reg; League Explore team. With your reusable LEGO&reg; Education SPIKE Essential technology set, you can give more of your team members hands-on coding and materials to explore potential solutions for their CARGO CONNECT model.

Complete your 2021-2022 *FIRST*&reg; LEGO&reg; League Explore season registration before September 30, 2021, for a chance to win

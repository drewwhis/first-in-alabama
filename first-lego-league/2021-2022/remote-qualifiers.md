# Remote Qualifiers

## Robot Rounds

Your team will submit three videos of robot rounds. Each video is 2.5 minutes long, the length of a single match, plus a little extra time. You will run each round as if you are at an actual competition. The videos will be reviewed by referees so your scores can be tallied.

Your videos can be recorded at your earliest convenience, but they must be submitted before the morning of your event.

A few things to keep in mind:
- Precision tokens will be kept track of by the referees.
- If you perform an illegal launch (e.g., robot isn't totally in the Launch Area when you send it out), nothing the robot does on that run will be counted. This is because at an event, the referee would stop your robot from leaving the Launch Area.
- Your videos should show the whole field for the entire duration.
- Your videos should start with a quick tour of the field to show everything in place, including all of your equipment in the Inspection Zone (large or small).
- Your videos should end with a brief tour of the field so the referees can check the end configuration.
- Each round must use a different configuration for the Sorting Center (Mission 10). There are six possible configurations, so you'll only need to show three of them.
- Make sure to review the [Remote Event Video Guidelines](https://firstinspiresst01.blob.core.windows.net/first-game-changers/fll-challenge/robot-game-video-recording-doc.pdf). There's also a [video reference](https://youtu.be/qPbwNQaQt4Y) available on YouTube.
- Make sure to review your [Robot Game Rules](https://firstinspiresst01.blob.core.windows.net/first-forward/fll-challenge/fll-challenge-cargo-connect-robot-game-rulebook.pdf) and [Challenge Updates](https://firstinspiresst01.blob.core.windows.net/first-forward/fll-challenge/fll-challenge-cargo-connect-challenge-updates.pdf).


## Judging

Your team will have a live, 30 minute judging session on the day of your event with a panel of judges via teleconferencing software. We will send the link to the coaches in advance of the event. While we recommend having the team in one place, we recognize this isn't possible for everyone. We do recommend practicing a virtual judging session with your team before the event.

A few things to keep in mind:
- Review the Judging Session Flow.
- Anything you want the judges to consider must be shown, demonstrated, or explained DURING the judging session.
- You are allowed to submit one PowerPoint presentation with five (5) slides. We recommend using at least one slide for each of Robot Design, Innovation Project, and Core Values. These slides should include only things you discuss in your presentation. We strongly recommend pictures and diagrams to help the judges understand.
- In your presentation and the PowerPoint, don't forget to describe/include some images of your robot code so the judges can include it in their considerations.
- The Zoom will be in tile/gallery mode (not speaker).
- Make sure to review the [Judging Flow](https://firstinspiresst01.blob.core.windows.net/first-forward/fll-challenge/fll-challenge-cargo-connect-judging-session-flowchart%202021.pdf) and the [Rubrics](http://firstinspiresst01.blob.core.windows.net/first-forward/fll-challenge/fll-challenge-cargo-connect-rubrics-2021-22.pdf).

As with any event, remember that judging constitutes about three-fourths of the Champion's Award and Advancement Criteria, so it's a very important 30 minutes!


## Awards and Advancement

All teams will receive a set of 12 CARGO CONNECT pins to commemorate their participation in this season.

We will have teams advance from each event to the state championship, which is still planned to be in-person. Approximately half of the teams participating in qualifiers will move on.

Some teams may win awards at their qualifiers, and we will get those to the teams as soon as we can. Be aware that the teams winning awards and the teams advancing are different groups; while there may be some overlap, the only award that GUARANTEES advancement is the Champion's Award.

We will have an Awards Ceremony via Zoom for each event on the day after the event. We will distribute those links at the same time we do the judging links to the coaches. Coaches, you will be responsible for distributing those to your teams.

We will also have an opportunity in the awards ceremony for each team to briefly present on their Innovation Project. Each team may prepare a two-minute "elevator pitch" to describe their project at the start of the ceremony. This won't affect any judged awards, but it will serve as a way to share your work with other teams.

# FIRSTÂ® LEGOÂ® League and FIRSTÂ® LEGOÂ® League Jr. Update

Hello teams!

This message is a bit dense (so apologies!). Iâ€™ve been hard at work the past two days on the mission models weâ€™ll have on hand for our kickoff event (the Inspire Set for FIRSTÂ® LEGOÂ® League Jr. is next on my list). Speaking of the kickoff...

## FIRSTÂ® LEGOÂ® League and FIRSTÂ® LEGOÂ® League Jr. Kickoff
Donâ€™t forget our state kickoff event for FIRSTÂ® LEGOÂ® League and FIRSTÂ® LEGOÂ® League Jr.! 

The event will be held at ADTRAN in Huntsville, AL, on Saturday, Sept. 1 from 1:00 PM to 4:00 PM (CDT).

We ask that all attending RSVP by August 29 through EventBrite using this link (disabled on GitHub). 
We ask that each person register with the link so that we can get an accurate head count. 
The event is open to coaches, and sessions will be geared toward them!

We understand that many of you may be unable to attend for a variety of reasons. 
We are working with ADTRAN to see what streaming/recording possibilities are available, if any. 
If we are able to live stream the event, I will have Slack running so that those off-site can get questions in. 
In any event, I plan to post any materials I can following the event.

Our plan is to have a series of alternating Q&A, break-out, and 10- to 15-minute topic overviews. 

Topics weâ€™re considering so far for brief overviews include:
* Judging in FLL
* The FIRST Progression of Programs
* The Open Software Pilot
* Event Registration
* What to Expect at an Event
* Slack

In addition to these topics, we plan to provide others for you to discuss in your own groups. 
For many of these topics, you may find many coaches more knowledgeable than Taylor or me and more able to address specific questions and ideas. 
Such topics include:
* Team structure and organization
* What does FLL and FLL Jr. look like for your team?
* How can FLL and FLL Jr. be interwoven with the curriculum?

If you have any topics youâ€™d like specifically addressed (in either category), you can email me, private-message me on Slack, or float the idea on the Slack channel. 

## Challenge Updates - FLL Only
Donâ€™t forget to watch https://www.firstinspires.org/resource-library/fll/into-orbit-challenge-updates-and-resources 
for Challenge Updates! (There may be a new one posted before you know it. ðŸ˜‰)

## Core Values Pilot - FLL Only, All Teams
As described in past emails, we will be piloting the new Core Values Rubric for judging. 

Do not refer to the Core Values Rubric found online at FIRST. 
The Project and Robot Design Rubrics will remain the same, but our region will use a different Core Values Rubric. 
I have attached it in this email, and it can be found on the GitHub site [here](https://github.com/drewwhis/first-in-alabama/blob/main/first-lego-league/2018_2019/judging/core-values/core-values-rubric-2018-pilot.pdf).

If you have questions about the Core Values Pilot, you can contact me or flljudge@firstinspires.org.

## Open Software Pilot - FLL Only, Opt-In
When you register for your qualifier (details to come later!), you will have the opportunity to opt into the Open Software Pilot for this season. 

For our region, please note these changes to the Challenge:
* R01 - ALL EQUIPMENT
  * All Equipment must be made of LEGO-made building parts in original factory condition. 
  * **Except**: Memory cards may be inserted into the Controller's card slot.
* R05 - OTHER ELECTRIC/ELECTRONIC THINGS
  * No other electric/electronic things are allowed in the competition area for Mission-related activity.
  * **Except**: Memory cards may be inserted into the Controller's card slot.
* R07 - SOFTWARE
  * **Except**: R07 â€“ SOFTWARE no longer applies.

Note that the robot must still run autonomously and cannot be tethered, per R05. 
These rule changes can be found [here](https://github.com/drewwhis/first-in-alabama/blob/main/first-lego-league/2018_2019/judging/robot-design/open-software-platform-pilot-robot-game-updates.pdf). 
FIRST reminds you that teams who choose to use software other than official MINDSTORMS software do so **_at their own risk_**.

There are many software solutions available for programming the LEGO MINDSTORMS. 
LEGO will provide limited technical support for [Microsoft MakeCode for EV3](https://www.lego.com/en-us/service). 
Any other software that is compatible with LEGO MINDSTORMS and does not violate other FIRST LEGO League rules may be used in competition, but they are NOT supported by LEGO.

Support for other software must come from the developers of that software. 
Some software options require internet access; be aware that many tournaments may not have have reliable public internet access. 
FIRST recommends bringing your own mobile hotspot if you will require internet access at your event.

I will also add that it is (theoretically) possible to program the EV3 using [LabView](http://sine.ni.com/nips/cds/view/p/lang/en/nid/212785), 
[RobotC](http://www.robotc.net/download/lego/), [Python](https://sites.google.com/site/ev3python/), 
[C/C++](https://c4ev3.github.io/), [Java](http://stemrobotics.cs.pdx.edu/node/4576), and other languages.

**Please be aware that I do not endorse nor have I tested any of the solutions listed**. 
They represent a few examples I was able to find with a quick Google perusal. 
If you are interested in the pilot, you may explore one of those options, the MakeCode option, or another option, as long as your choice meets the restrictions outlined above. 
Teams should be prepared to describe their programs to Judges who may not be familiar with the programming language the team used. 

If you have questions about the Open Software Pilot, you can contact me, flljudge@firstinspires.org, or fllrobotgame@firstinspires.org.

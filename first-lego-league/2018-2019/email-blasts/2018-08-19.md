# Kit Delays

Hello FLLers!

Quick note about mats and models (shout out to Rachel E. for providing some insight)!

The $299 fee includes mat and models this year. 
If you have paid the fee, you should have received an order confirmation from LEGO. 
You should later receive a shipping notification.

**If you received order confirmation more than a week ago and have not received a shipping notice, you may wish to follow up with LEGO.**

LEGO reported that they had an issue processing about 200 (total) teams’ orders. 
They will not be able to expedite the kits, and they will not push them through until teams affected contact them.

I don’t know how many of the teams affected are in our region, so please check with LEGO if you have gone more than a week between order confirmation and shipping notice.

For reference, I ordered a kit on Aug. 3 and received order confirmation the same day. 
I received a shipping notification on Aug. 9.

Your order confirmation has a customer service number to contact. 
I believe customer service is open until about 5 or 6 PM Eastern Time.

Let me know if I can provide any assistance!

Best,

Lawrence (Drew) Whisenant

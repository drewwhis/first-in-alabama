# FIRST® LEGO® League and FIRST® LEGO® League Jr. - Release Forms, Streaming, and Slack Channels

Hi all!

Two quick notes! Make sure to read them both thoroughly.

## FIRST LEGO League and FIRST LEGO League Jr. Kickoff Event
If you plan on attending the event (register here (disabled on GitHub) or participating remotely, you will need to make sure you have completed your consent and release form. 
If you have not yet done so, make sure to log into your Dashboard to complete the process ([brief overview here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=relrPJqWaKg)).

We will be streaming at this URL on YouTube (disabled on GitHub). 
I experienced about a 3 second latency, so plan for some delay, but I hope it will be manageable.

## Slack Channels
We’re quickly expanding how Slack is used with FIRST® in Alabama. 
FIRST® Tech Challenge (grades 7 - 12) is exploring the use of our FIRST in Alabama Slack group for their teams, so I’ve had to go in and make some changes to default channels.

If you signed up for Slack before 9:30 PM CDT on August 23, these changes do not affect you.

If you have not signed up yet, you will only be added to two channels:
* #first-general - This channel is for workspace-wide communication and announcements regarding FIRST® in Alabama.
* #random - A place for non-work-related flimflam, faffing, hodge-podge or jibber-jabber you'd prefer to keep out of more focused work-related channels.

Once in Slack, you will be able to join the other public channels. Our FLL and FLL Jr. specific channels are:
* #fll-general - General discussion for FIRST® LEGO® League in Alabama.
* #fll-project - Discussions regarding the FLL Project Component.
* #fll-robot-game - Discussions regarding the FLL Robot Game Component. This also includes Robot Design and Mission Mat and Models.
* #flljr-general - Community Q&A Regarding FIRST® LEGO® League Jr. in Alabama.

To browse channels or to join a channel, you can find a tutorial here: https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/205239967-Browse-and-join-channels.

I’ve also adjusted privacy settings so that email addresses are no longer visible on your profile page.

We have two big uses for Slack coming up.
* It will be used to take questions from those viewing the kickoff event remotely.
* As part of the Open Software Pilot, we are required to offer collaboration for participating teams. Slack will be our solution.

Remember, if you’d like to sign up, you can do so using this link (disabled on GitHub).

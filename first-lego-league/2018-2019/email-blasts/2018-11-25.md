# FIRST® LEGO® League Final Notes

Hello all!

The second round of qualifiers kicks off on Saturday! Everyone competiting at these events (or any event!) needs to make sure to read my previous message ([linked here](./2018-10-21.md)) **thoroughly**. There's a lot of information there, but we want to make sure everyone is prepared and knows what to expect (as best we can help).

As a reminder, all FIRST® events are free and open to the public, so if you've never competed before and your qualifier isn't until next week, you may want to check out Saturday's events at Columbia High School, Hampton Cove Middle School, or Crestline Elementary School.

If you have any general questions, feel free to contact me at dwhisenant@FIRSTinAlabama.org. If you have questions about your specific event (including payment), please direct those to your qualifier managers.

Best,

Drew

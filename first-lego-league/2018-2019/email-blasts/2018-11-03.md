# FIRST® LEGO® League Final Notes

Hello all!

The first qualifier kicks off in exactly one week! Everyone competiting at this event (or any event!) needs to make sure to read my last message ([linked here](./2018-10-21.md)) **thoroughly**. There's a lot of information there, but we want to make sure everyone is prepared and knows what to expect (as best we can help).

As a reminder, all FIRST® events are free and open to the public, so if you've never competed before and your qualifier isn't until December, you may want to check out Saturday's event at the UAH Shelby Center.

If you have any general questions, feel free to contact me at dwhisenant@FIRSTinAlabama.org. If you have questions about your specific event (including payment), please direct those to your qualifier managers.

Best,

Drew

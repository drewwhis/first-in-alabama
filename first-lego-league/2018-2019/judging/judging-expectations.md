Here are the requirements and expectations for judging this season.

  * Format: 4-minute teamwork activity, 3-minute Core Values Poster presentation, 3-minute question-and-answer.
  * Requirements: Complete and present the Core Values Poster and leave it with the judges.

Here are some additional notes that apply to all judging:
* Only the 2-10 student team members and two coaches may enter the judging rooms.
* Coaches are not to participate, interrupt, interfere, or signal to the team or judges. This __includes__ setup and tear-down.
* Other than the Core Values Poster, if your team wants to leave something with judges, construct it in such a way that you are comfortable not getting it back. __We only guarantee the return of the Core Values Poster__.

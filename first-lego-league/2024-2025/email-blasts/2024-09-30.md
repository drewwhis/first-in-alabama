Hello teams!

## Event Preferencing

Event preferencing for Challenge Teams is now open! Coaches should have received an email earlier this evening. If you **did not** receive the preferencing email for your Challenge Team (not Explore), follow these steps:
1. Check with any additional coaches on your team and confirm whether or not *they* received the message. Only one coach must submit preferencing.
2. If no coaches on your team have the information, please reach out to [Taylor Whisenant](mailto:twhisenant@firstpartners.org).

Preferencing will run until Friday, October 4. Teams will be notified of their assignments **no later than** Monday, October 7. While we cannot guarantee any specific event to any team, we do our best to maximize first and second choices among teams who complete preferencing. Teams who **do not** participate in preferencing will be assigned to whichever events have open capacity.

To help with planning, here are the qualifiers that will be offered:
- November 23 at Westminster Christian Academy in Madison, AL
- December 7 at Causey Middle School in Mobile, AL
- December 7 at Hampton Cove Middle School in Owens Cross Roads, AL
- December 7 at Academy for Academics and Arts (AAA) in Huntsville, AL

As a reminder for Explore Teams, your event is the Alabama Festival, which will be held on Saturday, March 15, 2025, at the von Braun Center in Huntsville, AL. Registration for teams in that division will open in January, so keep your eyes peeled!

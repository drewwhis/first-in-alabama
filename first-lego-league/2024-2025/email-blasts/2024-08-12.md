Hello teams!

Welcome to the 2024-2025 season [*FIRST*<sup>&reg;</sup> DIVE<sup>SM</sup> presented by Qualcomm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zM1wAo4eQzQ) and *FIRST*<sup>&reg;</sup> LEGO<sup>&reg;</sup> League [SUBMERGED<sup>SM</sup>](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JV7x014U0I).


## Season Launch (August 6) - Get Ready to DIVE in!

The SUBMERGED season is officially underway! Here are a few links to resources from *FIRST*<sup>&reg;</sup>:
- [Game and Season (all divisions)](https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/fll/game-and-season) - There are links on the page for Discover, Explore, and Challenge season materials.
- [*FIRST* LEGO League season page](https://www.firstlegoleague.org/season) - Additional resources for all divisions

In addition, for our Challenge teams, we have some deeper dive videos into some of the key documents for the current season on the *FIRST*<sup>&reg;</sup> in Alabama YouTube channel in the [SUBMERGED Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrGwasy9Lj6fsbxmrGGvlyC0pIv0x3qq8). 

You can also log into your [*FIRST* Dashboard](https://my.firstinspires.org/Dashboard/) to update your personal and team information. This is a great time to agree to the annual policies, complete Youth Protection Policy (YPP) screening if yours has expired, create new teams, and mark existing teams as returning. See our pages on registering an [Existing Team](https://github.com/drewwhis/first-in-alabama/wiki/Register-an-EXISTING-Team) or a [New Team](https://github.com/drewwhis/first-in-alabama/wiki/Adding-a-NEW-Team) for more information.


## Alabama Kickoff Event (August 24)

*FIRST*<sup>&reg;</sup> Robotics Competition Team 10101 - Critical Hit will be hosting a kickoff event for Alabama teams at New Century Technology High School in Huntsville, Alabama, on August 24. Our kickoff event will be open to all divisions of *FIRST* LEGO League, but it will be geared **heavily** toward the Challenge division.

To register (and order box lunches), visit [the registration page](https://forms.office.com/r/FS2qPwvsuj).


## Team Grants Available

*FIRST* provides a [Grant Locator Tool](https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/team-grants) for teams to find active grants that may apply to them, and some of these grants are available now!

Make sure to check the tool frequently as grants will be added and removed throughout the year!

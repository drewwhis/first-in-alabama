Hello teams!

## Build Day (September 21)

A joint build day event for *FIRST*<sup>&reg;</sup> LEGO<sup>&reg;</sup> League Challenge is being offered with *FIRST*<sup>&reg;</sup> Tech Challenge this Saturday, September 21 at Hampton Cove Middle School in Owens Cross Roads, AL, from noon to 3 PM.

This event will run similar to a scrimmage. You will have the ability to put your robot on the field and ask questions with the Head Referee, and practice judging will be available if you would like to sign up for it. Information sessions will also be available (each will last around 20 - 30 minutes). If you are interested in running a session (on a specific topic), please email [astrutzenberg@firstpartners.org](mailto:astrutzenberg@firstpartners.org).

To sign up for the Build Day event, visit the [web form](https://forms.office.com/pages/responsepage.aspx?id=v8Pzh9Ft7ES9j5nk5iLvhFSzSQV6YvFMsGGsHtihzNFUMlBTN0tJNlpFU0xINUJLV09GUDhWMzhMWC4u&route=shorturl).


## Challenge Updates and Clarifications

For our Challenge teams, it is important to stay up-to-date with the latest Challenge Updates and Clarifications. The latest updates were issued on September 3 (which come in addition to those released on August 6).

Please visit the [Challenge Updates and Clarifications document](https://firstinspires.blob.core.windows.net/fll/challenge/2024-25/fll-challenge-updates-and-clarifications.pdf) to stay informed!


## Event Preferencing (September 30)

We will open event preferencing for Challenge Qualifiers on Monday, September 30. Preferencing will run until Friday, October 4. Teams will be notified of their assignments **no later than** Monday, October 7. While we cannot guarantee any specific event to any team, we do our best to maximize first and second choices among teams who complete preferencing. Teams who **do not** participate in preferencing will be assigned to whichever events have open capacity.

To help with planning, here are the qualifiers that will be offered:
- November 23 at Westminster Christian Academy in Huntsville, AL
- December 7 at Causey Middle School in Mobile, AL
- December 7 at Hampton Cove Middle School in Owens Cross Roads, AL
- December 7 at Academy for Academics and Arts (AAA) in Huntsville, AL

For Explore teams, your event is the Alabama Festival, which will be held on Saturday, March 15 at the von Braun Center in Huntsville, AL. Registration for teams in that division will open in January, so keep your eyes peeled!

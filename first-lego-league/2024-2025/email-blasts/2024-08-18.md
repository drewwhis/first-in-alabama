Hello teams!

We're looking forward to the Alabama Kickoff event **this Saturday**!


## Alabama Kickoff Event (August 24)

*FIRST*<sup>&reg;</sup> Robotics Competition Team 10101 - Critical Hit will be hosting a kickoff event for Alabama teams at New Century Technology High School in Huntsville, Alabama, on August 24. Our kickoff event will be open to all divisions of *FIRST* LEGO League, but it will be geared **heavily** toward the Challenge division.

To register (and order box lunches), visit [the registration page](https://forms.office.com/r/FS2qPwvsuj). Please do so ASAP to ensure we have an accurate headcount.

We do not plan to *stream* the event, but we do plan to record various sessions and post them on the *FIRST* in Alabama YouTube (link to follow).


## *FIRST*<sup>&reg;</sup> LEGO<sup>&reg;</sup> League Challenge Qualifiers

We originally shared that we were planning for qualifier events on both 23 November and 7 December this year. At this time, we are still planning for events on 7 December, but we are having difficulties confirming venues for **any** 23 November events. At this time, we are suggesting that you anticipate only having qualifier options on the 7 December date.

If anything changes, we will report as soon as we can. We're still finalizing our locations, so we are not able to share additional qualifier information at this time.


## *FIRST*<sup>&reg;</sup> LEGO<sup>&reg;</sup> League Challenge *Potential* Build Day

We are considering offering a build day for Challenge teams on September 21 in Huntsville. A build day is a scrimmage-like setting with team-friendly rounds to get a chance to put a robot on the field and interact with referees prior to an event. We would also offer breakout panels to answer questions on judging.

If you are interested in attending the event, please complete [this survey](https://forms.office.com/r/pmaAgKYzCX). We will share in a future update if we have enough interest for the event!


## STEM Night at Toyota Field (29 August)

We have an opportunity to share with local *FIRST* teams from the Rocket City Trash Pandas. Please see the message below and email Joanna Berry ([tickets@trashpandasbaseball.com](mailto:tickets@trashpandasbaseball.com)) if your team is interested in participating.

    This exciting event [STEM Night] is dedicated to celebrating Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics within the Huntsville community during our baseball game against the Tennessee Smokies. We are planning an evening filled with engaging activities, and opportunities for local organizations and clubs to showcase their contributions to the STEM fields, while also enjoying an action-packed baseball game! This event aims to inspire young minds, foster a love for STEM subjects, highlight the incredible innovations and educational opportunities available in our community, and give youth clubs the opportunity to publicly showcase some of their cool projects! We would be thrilled to have your club involved in this terrific night. Your participation could include hosting a table on the concourse, providing small demonstrations in the outfield kids zone area and/or on the field, or any other interactive activity that showcases your work in STEM, while also bringing a group out for the game. This is a fantastic opportunity to connect with the community, inspire the next generation of STEM enthusiasts, and attract new members to join your team!

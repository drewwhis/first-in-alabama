# What's New in BOOMTOWN BUILD?

This document is **not comprehensive**. Make sure to read all challenge documents and challenge updates thoroughly. We will try to highlight any big changes or important things to note.

## Team Meeting Guide and Engineering Notebook

*FIRST*<sup>&reg;</sup> LEGO<sup>&reg;</sup> League Jr. had these sort of documents last year, but there's been a big overhaul! You won't be reviewed on how you used these documents during the season, but they'll be supremely useful in having a successful season!

## Flexible Scheduling

The FLL Jr. season is designed so that you can complete **everything** in 12, one-hour sessions with your team. Obviously spending more time across more sessions will benefit your team, but this is the minimum recommended to get to everything.

In the Team Meeting Guide, *FIRST* has provided guides to complete the season in the 12 sessions, as well as guides for how to handle the season if your availability is more limited, like only six or nine sessions.

## Printed Build Instructions

The digital versions of the building instructions for the Inspire Set are available as always online, but this year *FIRST* is also including a printed copy with your Inspire Set. We hope this helps your team!

## Inspire Set Versions

Like each season, your Inspire Set will be incorporated into your team's model. This season, though, the Inspire Set has *two* configurations, and your team can choose one for the model - either the Crane or Elevator.

*Tip* It might be a good idea for your team to be able to explain *why* or *how* they chose to use one configuration over the other to reviewers at an event.

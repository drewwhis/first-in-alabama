Hello teams! 

If you have not signed up for a timeslot at our table test event (and would like to do so), we have plenty of slots remaining! 

Each team can sign up for a 30-minute block of time, and we can support six teams concurrently. The event will run from 10 AM to 3 PM, but keep in mind that, due to space limitations, you should only be on-site for your 30-minute window.

To register, enter your team **number** and select your time block using [our Doodle form](). **DO NOT** enter personal or team names. Any entry that **is not** a registered team number will be removed. 

For parking and entrance information, we have a map posted.

Please let us know if you have any questions!

Best,

Drew and Taylor Whisenant

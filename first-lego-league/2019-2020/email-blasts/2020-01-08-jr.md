Hello FLL Jr. teams!

We have now opened registration for the *FIRST*<sup>&reg;</sup> LEGO<sup>&reg;</sup> League Jr. expo season!

The *FIRST*<sup>&reg;</sup> LEGO<sup>&reg;</sup> League Jr. Alabama Expo will be held on April 4, 2020, at the von Braun Center in Huntsville. All paid, registered Alabama teams are eligible to attend. There is no fee to attend the event (but you must have paid your registration with *FIRST*). **You must register no later than March 1, 2020.**

We are also accepting teams to enter the lottery to represent Alabama at the *FIRST*<sup>&reg;</sup> LEGO<sup>&reg;</sup> League Jr. World Festival Expo in Houston, TX, April 15 through 18. There is a fee of \$300 to attend this event if a team selected. **The state lottery will close on January 18, 2020.** The team submitted from our region will then be entered into a lottery at the World level. We can provide more information on this process if you have questions.

To register for the Alabama Expo and enter the lottery for the World Festival Expo, please complete [this form](https://forms.gle/sMtqgmSZmMaEb1wZ9). Be aware that you **cannot attend either event** if you have not paid your team registration to *FIRST*. We will give lottery priority to teams attending the Alabama Expo.

Please let us know if you have any questions!

Best,

Drew and Taylor Whisenant

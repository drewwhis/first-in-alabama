Hello everyone!

We have concluded the qualifier phase of the *FIRST*<sup>&reg;</sup> LEGO<sup>&reg;</sup> League CITY SHAPER<sup>SM</sup> season in the Alabama region!

Thirty-six teams will be joining us for the *FIRST*<sup>&reg;</sup> LEGO<sup>&reg;</sup> League Alabama Championship on January 25, 2020 at Hampton Cove Middle School (listed below), and we have a complete posting of qualifier results [here](https://github.com/drewwhis/first-in-alabama/blob/main/first-lego-league/2019-2020/results.md).

If you are not affilated with a competing team, we have a lot of volunteer opportunities available at the state championship! Volunteering is a great way to learn A LOT about the program in a very short period of time. If that's something you're interested in, we have instructions on how to volunteer available [here](https://github.com/drewwhis/first-in-alabama/wiki/Becoming-an-Event-Volunteer). If you have questions, let us know! We have several coaches in Alabama who have volunteered at events in the past, and they can speak to the benefits directly.

For those teams not competing, this is *probably* the last message you'll receive until a grant process or registration for the 2020-2021 season opens up. If you need to remove yourself from the *FIRST*<sup>&reg;</sup> distribution list, we have those instructions available [here](https://github.com/drewwhis/first-in-alabama/wiki/Leaving-a-Team).

Thank you to those who joined us this season, and we hope you have a wonderful holiday season and a great start to 2020!

Best,

Drew and Taylor Whisenant

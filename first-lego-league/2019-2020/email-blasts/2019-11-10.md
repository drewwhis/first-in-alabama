Hello teams!

Qualifier Week One is here! We have a few reminders to make sure everyone gets the most out of the experience.

## Table Test

We would like to thank the teams that showed up to Saturday's table test! Teams were able to get a feel for table variances, and we were able to clarify some misconceptions!

Some things we were able to remind teams about:
- You robot and equipment must be 12 inches or shorter and fit entirely within the Launch Area when launching (Rule 21).
- To not lose a Precision Token, the robot must return and be complete in Home, not the Launch Area (Rule 27).
- Appropriate use of jigs (Robot Game Update 21).


## What To Expect

We have a few resources to point you to! You've received some of these before, but I suggest you look over them thoroughly so there are no surprises!

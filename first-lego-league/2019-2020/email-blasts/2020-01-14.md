Hello teams!

With just a few days to go, I wanted to make sure we sent out a couple of reminders. In addition to the team-specific schedules we've aleady sent, we've included an overview schedule of the whole day.

## Payment 

The fee to compete in the event is \$100. You can submit payment to:

    FIRST in Alabama
    3002 Boundary Oaks Drive
    Owens Cross Roads, AL 35763

Make sure to include your TEAM NUMBER so we know where to apply the payment!

If you need an invoice or W-9, email Taylor at twhisenant@FIRSTinAlabama.org.


## Team Numbers at State

This year, we will be replacing your team number at the state event! All teams will be assigned a number from 1 to 36. Be on the lookout for more information after the first of the year.


## Lunch Orders

If you are interested in getting lunches for your team(s), you can contact Melissa Snider. Her email address is included in the recipients of this message.


## Team Information Sheet

We ask that you complete and email the Team Information Sheet in advance of the event. Please email your completed sheet to dwhisenant@FIRSTinAlabama.org no later than Friday, January 17, 2020. This will give us plenty of time to get them printed for the judges.

**Please make sure to use your 1-36 team number in the form.** If you already sent me your form, I have corrected it, so please **do not resend** it.


## Judging and Awards

Please don't forget to review the judging requirements.

Judging expectations remain the same from the qualifiers. If you need a refresher, refer to the [Judging and Advancement](https://github.com/drewwhis/first-in-alabama/blob/main/first-lego-league/2019-2020/fll/judging-and-advancement.md) document.

As an overview:
- Robot Design: four minutes to cover the Robot Design Executive Summary followed by six minutes for Q&A.
- Innovation Project: five minutes for the presentation followed by five minutes for Q&A.
- Core Values: five minutes for the Core Values activity followed by five minutes for Q&A.

Only team members and the two coaches will be allowed in the judging rooms. You may **not record, film, or take pictures** during the Core Values session, but you may during the other two.

We will give an award for each of the nine areas (the nine sections of the rubrics). We will name three finalists for the Champion's Award; of those three teams, one will be named the Champion's Award Winner. We will also present the award for the highest score during the ranking rounds.

At this time, we anticipate having three invites to post-season events, including an invitation to the *FIRST*<sup>&reg;</sup> LEGO<sup>&reg;</sup> League World Festival in Houston, Texas, for the Champion's Award Winner.


## Closing

If for any reason your team will not attend the championship event, please let us know AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. We have room for 36 teams and we would really like to make sure we use every spot!

If you have questions or need to request accommodations, please let us know at FLL@FIRSTinAlabama.org.

We look forward to a great state championship event!

Best,

Drew and Taylor Whisenant

Good evening, Coaches!

Registration for the FIRST LEGO League Jr BOOMTOWN BUILDSM Challenge is open! :-)

Here is our general season timeline. We will send more specific info about event dates as we confirm them.
- August 1, 2019: BOOMTOWN BUILDSM Global Challenge Release
- August 2019 to April 2020: Event Season
- April 2020: FIRST LEGO League Jr Alabama Expo
- April 15-18, 2020: FIRST LEGO League Jr World Festival Expo - Houston, Texas

Here is an updated list of costs for running a team. I have included some information about TVA grants below.
- Team Registration (Includes 1 Inspire Set, 6 Engineering Notebooks, and 2 Team Meeting Guides) (\$99)
- LEGO Education WeDo 2.0 Core Set (reusable) (\$189)

FIRST is currently working with TVA to secure funding for the \$99 registration fee for teams located in TVA service areas. Teams have the option of registering and paying themselves OR can wait until TVA funding has been secured and register at that point. If they register and pay themselves, there is no option for reimbursement. I will update you as soon as I am notified about the timeline and process for these grants.

Please let me know if you have any questions or need any help!

Best,

Taylor and Drew Whisenant

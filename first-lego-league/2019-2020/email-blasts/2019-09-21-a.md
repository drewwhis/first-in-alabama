Hello Lead Coach/Mentor 1 Contacts!

This is your qualifier registration email.

Please keep a few things in mind before you fill out the registration form.
1. Registration is not first-come, first-serve.
2. You will need to rank your preferences for all events (one through six).
3. We **cannot** guarantee **any** team a spot at **any** specific event, but we guarantee **every** team a spot at **some** event.
4. We will do our best to maximize first and second choices.
5. You must complete the registration form by **Friday, September 27 at 11:59 PM CDT**.
6. Make sure to complete the form on a desktop or laptop computer. It may not display properly on a phone or small tablet.

After registration closes, we will assign and notify teams of their placements.

Once assigned, await further information from your Qualifier Manager. They will send you schedules, tournament information, and payment information. That information will not come from us.

If you run into any issues with the registration process, let us know at FLL@FIRSTinAlabama.org. Once a team has been registered, we will remove them from the list as quickly as we can (usually within a day) to prevent a double-registration. If a team does get registered twice, we will use the **most recent** registration from **Lead Coach/Mentor 1**.

The link to the registration form is [here](). Be aware that the link is not available on the GitHub site.

Best,

Drew and Taylor Whisenant

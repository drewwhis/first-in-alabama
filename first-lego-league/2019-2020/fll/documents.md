# Important Documents

## Engineering Notebook

The Engineering Notebook is a document geared toward the students on your team. Each student will need a copy, and you should receive all 10 copies with your team registration.

Information in the Engineering Notebook includes: The Challenge (Robot Game and Innovation Project, the *FIRST* Core Values, Field Setup (**not** building instructions), Robot Game Missions, Robot Game Rules and Definitions, and student session guides.


## Team Meeting Guide

The Team Meeting Guide is the coach's complement to the Engineering Notebook, and you should receive both copies with your team registration.

Information in the Team Meeting Guide includes: The Challenge (Robot Game and Innovation Project, the *FIRST*<sup>&reg;</sup> Core Values, What Materials Do I Need?, Resources, Software Installation and Robot Lessons, Robot Game Missions, coach session guides, and additional planning and preparation tools.

Be aware that the Team Meeting Guide does **not** includes the robot game rules and defintions or the Field Setup instructions. You'll need to complement the Team Meeting Guide with the Game Guide (see below).


## [Challenge Updates](https://firstinspiresst01.blob.core.windows.net/fll/2020/city-shaper-challenge-updates.pdf)

Sometimes things need clarifying or unexpected problems need resolving. For those reasons, the Challenge is open to updates throughout the season. You should consult this document **at least weekly** to make sure you're up to speed.

## [Rubrics](https://firstinspiresst01.blob.core.windows.net/fll/2020/first-lego-league-rubrics.pdf)

In a *FIRST*<sup>&reg;</sup> LEGO<sup>&reg;</sup> League competition, your team will be evaluated in part based on the robot's highest score during matches. Most of your team's evaluation, however, comes from three judging areas: Robot Design, Innovation Project, and Core Values.

These rubrics are the same forms that judges will use to give teams feedback after their judging sessions, so it's important that your team studies them and practices against them!


## [Table Building Instructions](https://www.firstinspires.org/sites/default/files/uploads/resource_library/fll/table-build.pdf)

If you need to build a table like the ones used in competition, these instructions will help! Be aware that at competition you may encounter tables that use 2x3's or 2x4's.


## [Robot Game Score Sheet](https://firstinspiresst01.blob.core.windows.net/fll/2020/city-shaper-scoresheet.pdf)

After each match **one student** will confer with a referee to ensure both agree on what the team did and did not accomplish during the match. The student must then sign-off of the score sheet.

It is our policy that only the referees, scorekeeper, and student will see the score sheet, so it's important that your students understand the form. Note that the score sheet will **not** have numerical scores. The scoring is done separately based off of the mission requirements. Once the student signs the scoresheet, it is submitted for scoring, and the time to discuss the score has passed.


## [Participation Rules](http://firstlegoleague.org/challenge#block-block-17)

We want to make sure all teams fully understand the definition of a team and what it means for a team to fully participate in *FIRST*<sup>&reg;</sup> LEGO<sup>&reg;</sup> League. This document outlines those details.


## [One-Page Challenge PDF](https://firstinspiresst01.blob.core.windows.net/fll/2020/city-shaper-challenge.pdf)

Do you want an easy way to explain the Challenge to someone outside the team, at a high level? This is the document for you!
	

## [Mission Model Building Instructions](http://www.firstlegoleague.org/missionmodelbuildinginstructions)

These are the instructions needed to correctly **assemble** the mission models in the challenge set. These instructions do **not** cover how to arrange the models on the mat, but that is covered in both the Engineering Notebook and the Game Guide.


## [Season Logos](https://firstinspiresst01.blob.core.windows.net/first-rise/city-shaper/CITY-SHAPER-logos.zip)

Want to incorporate the CITY SHAPER<sup>SM</sup> season logos into your own materials? Here's the download for you!


## [Branding Guidelines](https://firstinspiresst01.blob.core.windows.net/first-rise/city-shaper/FIRST-RISE-Style-Guide-programs-FLL-v3.pdf)

We want to encourage everyone to use the *FIRST*<sup>&reg;</sup> name and logos as best they can, so we're providing you with a link to *FIRST*'s branding guidelines, should you need them.

## [Game Guide](https://firstinspiresst01.blob.core.windows.net/fll/2020/city-shaper-game-guide-pdf.pdf)

The Game Guide makes a great supplement to the Team Meeting Guide. Like the Team Meeting Guide, it includes the Robot Game Missions, but it also includes the Field Setup Instructions for arranging the models on the mat and the Robot Game Rules and Definitions, which are just as important as the Robot Game Missions.


## [Table Overview](https://firstinspiresst01.blob.core.windows.net/fll/2020/city-shaper-table-overview.pdf)

The Table Overview is a top-level view of the robot game mat, with mission locations labeled. It's a great tool to use for sketching paths the robot could take over the course of a mission. 


## [*FIRST*<sup>&reg;</sup> LEGO<sup>&reg;</sup> League Robot Lessons (EV3)](https://firstinspiresst01.blob.core.windows.net/fll/2020/fll-ev3-overview.pdf)

This document includes a series of programming lessons for the EV3. It also includes *one* solution for achieving The Crane Mission (Mission 2).

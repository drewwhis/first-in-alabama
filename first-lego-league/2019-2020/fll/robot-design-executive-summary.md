# Robot Design Executive Summary

These are guidelines provided by *FIRST*<sup>&reg;</sup> regarding the Robot Design Executive Summary (RDES).

## Overview

To help the Robot Design Judges quickly and consistently learn about your robot and the design process used, we are requiring a short presentation. 

An “executive summary” is often used by engineers to briefly outline the key elements of a product or project. In other words, the purpose of the RDES is to give the Robot Design Judges an outline of your robot and all that it can do. 

The RDES is intended to help your team consider in advance the most important information to share with the Judges. What you chose to share will enable the Judges to effectively evaluate your team and provide more helpful feedback.

Your team is free to determine how much time you invest, but realistically it should only take a few hours to develop and practice the RDES. The RDES is NOT intended to be as extensive or time consuming as your Innovation Project.

Your team will present your RDES at the beginning of your Robot Design judging session. The entire presentation should not take any longer than four (4) minutes. 

Following your Robot Design presentation the Judges will pose questions for your team to answer. You are not required to provide a written version of the RDES to leave with the Judges.


## Basic Outline

The RDES should include Robot Facts and Design Details.

### Robot Facts

Share with the Judges a little bit about your robot, such as the number and type of sensors, drivetrain details, number of parts, and the number of attachments. The Judges would also like to know what programming language you used, the number of programs and the amount of memory used by each program, and your most consistently completed mission.


### Design Details

1. **Fun**: Describe the most fun or interesting part of robot design as well as the most challenging parts. If your robot has a name, who chose the name and why. If your team has a fun story about your robot please feel free to share.

2. **Strategy**: Explain your team’s strategy and reasoning for choosing and accomplishing missions. Talk a little bit about how successful your robot was in completing the missions that you chose. Judges may like to hear about your favorite mission and why it is your favorite.

3. **Design Process**: Describe how your team designed your robot and what process you used to make improvements to your design over time. Briefly share how different team members contributed to the design and how you incorporated all the ideas.

4. **Mechanical Design**: Explain to the Judges your robot’s basic structure, how you make sure your robot is durable and how you made it easy to repair or add/remove attachments. Explain to the Judges how the robot moves (drivetrain), and what attachments and mechanisms it uses to operate or complete missions.

5. **Programming**: Describe how you programmed your robot to ensure consistent results. Explain how you organized and documented your programs, as well as, mention if your programs use sensors to know (and ensure) the location of the robot on the field.

6. **Innovation**: Describe any features of your robot design that you feel are special, different or especially clever.


If you would like to demonstrate the robot functioning, try to incorporate that demonstration into one of the components described above. This will save time and reinforce what the team is describing. Keep in mind that there will **not** be a competition table, mat, or models in the judging room.

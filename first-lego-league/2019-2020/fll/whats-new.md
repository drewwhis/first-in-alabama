# What's New in CITY SHAPER?

This document is **not comprehensive**. Make sure to read all challenge documents and challenge updates thoroughly. We will try to highlight any big changes or important things to note.

## Team Meeting Guide and Engineering Notebook

*FIRST*<sup>&reg;</sup> LEGO<sup>&reg;</sup> League introduced an optional Engineering Notebook last season, but there's been a big overhaul! You won't be judged on how you used these documents during the season, but they'll be supremely useful in having a successful season!


## The Innovation Project

The Project has a shiny, new name - the Innovation Project! Aside from giving all three judging areas consistent, two-word names, the new name emphasizes what we're looking for from teams in this area - innovation!


## *FIRST* Core Values

Returning teams will remember the Core Values Judging Pilot last season. Those changes have been incorporated into Global Judging, so we're committed to the *FIRST*-wide Core Values.


## Connecting the Robot Game and Innovation Project

We want teams to recognize that the Innovation Project and Robot Game are two sides of the same coin, so this season we're bringing them together!

In your Challenge Set is a collection of white LEGO bricks. These are meant for your team to build a prototype model of your final team Project. You'll bring this model to your competitions and use it in the Innovative Architecture Mission!


## No More Touch Penalties! (Sort Of)

What we used to call Touch Penalties have been converted into Mission 14 - Precision! Each match, the team will start with six precision tokens on the field. As the match progresses, the team can lose precision tokens (see the challenge for details). At the end of the match, the team will earn points for Mission 14 based on how many tokens remain.


## Open Software

*FIRST* is moving forward with the Open Sofware initiative! Starting this season, you can program with LEGO MINDSTORMS robot with (almost) anything! You are allowed to use any programming tool that allows the robot to move autonomously (on its own). As always, the robot cannot be controlled remotely.

Whatever you use, you'll want to make sure that it does not require a Bluetooth connection or tethering via wire during the match. If you're unsure if something is allowed, please ask!

If you want to get started with something other than blocks, LEGO has official support for Python available [here](https://education.lego.com/en-us/support/mindstorms-ev3/python-for-ev3).


## What is the Launch Area?

If you've been with us before, this is what we **used to call** Home. This is the quarter circle in the southwest corner of the mat. It does **not** include the white band of sponsor logos.


## Home Is Different!

If you've been with us before, you'll notice the mats are smaller! When aligned properly, there will be an area on the west end of the table that is not covered by the mat. This entire open area is Home. Notice that Home does **not** include the Launch Area.


## Mat Placement

When placing your Field on an Official Table, slide the Mat gently until it meets up against the South and East Border Walls. When Table size and Mat placement are correct, Home will measure about 45 inches by 15-1/2 inches (1143 mm by 393 mm). To hold the Mat in place, you may use a thin strip of black tape on the West edge as needed. Where the tape sticks to the Mat, it may cover the Matâ€™s black border only


## Where are the Inspection Areas?

You can think of Home as being divided into two sections - a north section and a south section that meet at the black line that defines the Launch Area. 

The Small Inspection Area is the south section of Home, starting from the southern wall of the table and extending to the black line that defines the Launch Area. The Small Inspection Area extends up, toward the ceiling, for 12 inches.

The Large Inspection Area is the north section of Home, starting from the northern wall of the table and extending to the black line that defines the Launch Area. The Large Inspection Area extends up, toward the ceiling, for 12 inches.

Before the start of a match, **all** of your equipment must fit in **one** of the Inspection Areas.


## Inspection

This season, there's a bigger restriction on how many things you can bring to the table and use in a match! Before the match starts, the referee will check that **all** of your equipment for the match fits in **one of two areas** on the table (the Large or Small Inspection Areas) up to 12 inches high. This change is in addition to the usual rules relating to robot size, which is the same as last season.

If your equipment fits in the Small Inspection Area, the team will earn a bonus for each mission completed (except Mission 14). Note that the Large Inspection Area does **not** include the Small Inspection Area. They are adjacent to each other, and **all** of your equipment must fit in **one** of them.

Once you've finished inspection, the Inspection Areas don't matter anymore, so don't worry about them once you've proven that everything fits!


## Interruptions

The new area designations (Home and Launch Area) will affect how we handle interruptions, with changes due to introduction of the Launch Area as a separate area from Home.

The definition of an interruption has not changed. When you tell the robot to GO, the next time you touch the robot counts as an interruption. If the robot is completely in **Home**, then it's a safe interruption. 

In addition to interrupting while completely in Home, it is safe to touch the robot during a Launch preparation. Launch is when you make the robot GO, **not** when it leaves the Launch Area. If you interrupt the robot **after** pressing GO but **before** it reaches the Launch Area perimeter line, you will **not** lose a Precision Token. If the robot **has reached** the Launch Area perimeter line, you **will** lose a Precision Token.


## Cargo and Interruptions

The interruption rules and Launch Area designation will also how we handle any Cargo the robot is carrying if it is interrupted.

If you interrupt the robot, you might lose the Cargo.

*Where did the robot get the Cargo?* If the robot got the Cargo in the Launch Area from the latest Launch, you can keep it! If not, it depends on the interruption.

*Where was the **Cargo** when the robot was interrupted?* If the **Cargo** is completely in Home, you can keep it! If not, the referee takes it.

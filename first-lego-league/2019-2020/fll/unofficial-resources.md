# Unofficial Resources

These are resources not provided by *FIRST* or LEGO for *FIRST*<sup>&reg;</sup> LEGO<sup>&reg;</sup> League.

## [EV3 Lessons](http://ev3lessons.com/)

Thanks to Jamie for this suggestion!

EV3Lessons is run by FRC Team Not the Droids You Are Looking For. It was founded in 2014 as a way to share high-quality, open-source MINDSTORMS programming lessons.

## [EV3 Python Type Hints](https://pypi.org/project/pybricks-stubs/)

If you're playing with the official LEGO<sup>&reg;</sup> Python support for the EV3, there's an unofficial Python package you can install that will provide type hints while writing code.

You can install the unoffical, experimental package using the title link. If you encounter any problems, you can report them on the [package's GitHub page](https://github.com/drewwhis/pybricks-stubs).

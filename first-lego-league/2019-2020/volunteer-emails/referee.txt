Hello, and thank you for volunteering your time with us!

Our events would not be possible without the support of volunteers like you. We appreciate your time, and so do the students participating.

As a referee, you must be familiar with the robot game, including the inspection rules. Please watch the short overview of the game (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_mTQZQ8Kzc) and read the Game Guide (https://firstinspiresst01.blob.core.windows.net/fll/2020/city-shaper-game-guide-a4.pdf) prior to the event. You will also want to familiarize yourself with the Robot Game Updates in the Challenge Updates (https://firstinspiresst01.blob.core.windows.net/fll/2020/city-shaper-challenge-updates.pdf).

You will receive hands-on training from the Head Referee at your event. Training will take place on ((DATE)) at ((TIME)) at ((LOCATION)).

Hello!

My name is Dancy Castle, and I am the Volunteer Coordinator for *FIRST*<sup>&reg;</sup> LEGO<sup>&reg;</sup> League (FLL) in Alabama. I am contacting you today to let you know about volunteer opportunities for you and your organization.

I have included some information about the four *FIRST*<sup>&reg;</sup> programs below. [*FIRST*<sup>&reg;</sup> in Alabama](http://www.firstinalabama.org) is the local non-profit organization delivering the K-12 progression of [*FIRST*<sup>&reg;</sup>](https://www.firstinspires.org) programs to the state of Alabama.

Our events would not be possible without the support of volunteers, and we would love to have volunteers from your company at our *FIRST*<sup>&reg;</sup> in Alabama competitions this season.

#### [*FIRST*<sup>&reg;</sup> LEGO<sup>&reg;</sup> League Jr. (FLL Jr.)](https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/flljr)

*FIRST*<sup>&reg;</sup> LEGO<sup>&reg;</sup> League Jr. is designed to introduce STEM concepts to kids ages 6 to 10 while exciting them through a brand they know and love − LEGO<sup>&reg;</sup>.

Guided by adult coaches and *FIRST*<sup>&reg;</sup> Core Values, students build models using LEGO<sup>&reg;</sup> Education WeDo 2.0 and create Show Me posters to present what they learned. The program focuses on building interest in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) through a real-world challenge – to be solved by research, critical thinking, and imagination.


#### [*FIRST*<sup>&reg;</sup> LEGO<sup>&reg;</sup> League (FLL)](https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/fll)

When students are engaged in hands-on STEM experiences, they build confidence, grow their knowledge and develop habits of learning. When adults coach these students, they encourage them to try, fail, and try again, while connecting STEM concepts to real-world examples.

*FIRST*<sup>&reg;</sup> LEGO<sup>&reg;</sup> League is the most accessible, guided, global robotics competition, helping students and teachers to build a better future together. The program is built around theme-based Challenges to engage children ages 9 to 14 in research, problem solving, coding, and engineering. The foundation of the program is the *FIRST*<sup>&reg;</sup> Core Values, which emphasize teamwork, discovery, and innovation. Students emerge more confident, excited, and equipped with the skills they need in a changing workforce.


#### [*FIRST*<sup>&reg;</sup> Tech Challenge (FTC)](https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/ftc)

It’s way more than building robots. *FIRST*<sup>&reg;</sup> Tech Challenge teams (up to 15 team members, grades 7-12) are challenged to design, build, program, and operate robots to compete in a head-to-head challenge in an alliance format.

Guided by adult coaches and mentors, students develop STEM skills and practice engineering principles, while realizing the value of hard work, innovation, and working as a team.

The robot kit is reusable from year to year and can be coded using a variety of levels of Java-based programming. Teams design and build robots, raise funds, design and market their team brand, and do community outreach to earn specific awards. Participants are eligible to apply for $80M+ in college scholarships.

Each season concludes with regional championship events and an exciting *FIRST*<sup>&reg;</sup> Championship.


#### [*FIRST*<sup>&reg;</sup> Robotics Competition (FRC)](https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc)

Combining the excitement of sport with the rigors of science and technology. We call *FIRST*<sup>&reg;</sup> Robotics Competition the ultimate Sport for the Mind. High-school student participants call it “the hardest fun you’ll ever have.”

Under strict rules, limited time and resources, teams of students are challenged to raise funds, design a team "brand," hone teamwork skills, and build and program industrial-size robots to play a difficult field game against like-minded competitors. It’s as close to real-world engineering as a student can get. Volunteer professional mentors lend their time and talents to guide each team. Each season ends with an exciting *FIRST*<sup>&reg;</sup> Championship.

# FLL and FLL Jr. Kickoff Event RSVP

Hello all!

## Kickoff Event
We have finalized our details for the state kickoff event for FIRST® LEGO® League and FIRST® LEGO® League Jr.! 
The event will be held at ADTRAN in Huntsville, AL, on Saturday, Sept. 1 from 1:00 PM to 4:00 PM (CDT).

We ask that all attending RSVP by August 29 through EventBrite using this link (disabled on GitHub). 
We ask that each person register with the link so that we can get an accurate head count. 
The event is open to coaches, and sessions will be geared toward them!

Our plan is to have a series of alternating Q&A, break-out, and 10- to 15-minute topic overviews. 
If you have any topics you’d like specifically addressed, you can email me, private-message me on Slack, or float the idea on the Slack channel.

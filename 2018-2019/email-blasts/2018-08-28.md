# FIRST(R) LEGO(R) League and FIRST(R) LEGO(R) League Jr. Reminders

Hello teams!

I hope this is my last message to you before our kickoff on Saturday, but we’ll see!

## FIRST® LEGO® League and FIRST® LEGO® League Jr. Kickoff and Streaming
If you plan to participate, here are some useful links. 
Please remember that this event is for coaches (we may also have some referees in attendance). 
Do not bring team members or other students, as we will not have materials prepared for them.

In-person? 
* Register to attend by 11:59 PM Wednesday: register here (disabled on GitHub).
* Need directions? [Google Maps](https://goo.gl/maps/RbKRVDMrQjt)!
* I’ve attached a marked-up image indicating where you should park/enter.

Remote? 
* Stream the event on YouTube: view here (disabled on GitHub).
* Sign up for Slack to ask questions remotely: sign up here (disabled on GitHub).
* Join the #fll-general or #flljr-general channel: [details here](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/205239967-Browse-and-join-channels).

Everyone! 
* Complete your Consent and Release Form in your Dashboard: [brief overview here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=relrPJqWaKg).

I’m meeting with ADTRAN tomorrow to confirm arrangements, so if my map is wrong, I will send an updated version.

For those in attendance, some specific items you might wish to bring with you are:
* A laptop with the MINDSTORMS or WeDo software installed,
* An MINDSTORMS or WeDo module (just the main brick!), one motor, and one sensor (we might have time to play around with components),
* Lots of questions!

In addition to coaches, we may have some event volunteers (specifically Referees and Robot Design Judges) in attendance who want to check out this season’s field.

## AMSTI Grant

## ESA Space Insights Video Series
The first three videos of the series have been uploaded to the FIRST LEGO League YouTube Channel [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpaPRqT711tiFR7xRbrFgV24NtnQONghH). 
In these videos, experts from the European Space Agency explain a wide range of interesting subjects, such as gravity, space food, robots and the Moon. 

More videos will be added to this playlist over the next few months, but make sure to start checking out this great Project resource with your team now!

## Update Contact Information
Please make sure the contact information for your team is up to date! If you are no longer affiliated with a team, make sure to log into your Dashboard at www.firstinspires.org to invite your replacement. If your team no longer exists, you should also be able to leave the team in your Dashboard. Please allow up to one week for our records to reflect the update.

## Slack Channels
Our Slack is a great tool to use all season for all of our coaches! When you sign up, you will be added to two channels:
* #first-general - This channel is for workspace-wide communication and announcements regarding FIRST® in Alabama.
* #random - A place for non-work-related flimflam, faffing, hodge-podge or jibber-jabber you'd prefer to keep out of more focused work-related channels.

Once in Slack, you will be able to join the other public channels. Our FLL and FLL Jr. specific channels are:
* #fll-general - General discussion for FIRST® LEGO® League in Alabama.
* #fll-project - Discussions regarding the FLL Project Component.
* #fll-robot-game - Discussions regarding the FLL Robot Game Component. This also includes Robot Design and Mission Mat and Models.
* #flljr-general - Community Q&A Regarding FIRST® LEGO® League Jr. in Alabama.

We also have a private channel set up for those teams who will elect to participate in the Open Software Pilot (we’ll add you after registration).

To browse channels or to join a channel, you can find a tutorial here: https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/205239967-Browse-and-join-channels.

## TVA Grants
There’s still time to apply for TVA Grants (see the link below, disabled on GitHub). If you have received a grant and you can see it in your account, you must complete the checkout process in order to process your registration.

# FLL Qualifier Preference Update

Hello teams!

Just wanted to provide a quick update on Qualifier Registration.

## Qualifier Preference Selection
Most teams have completed the process so far. Most remaining teams fall into one of two categories.
1. Teams that have completed FIRST registration but have not completed qualifier selection.
2. Teams that are waiting for FIRST to process payment.

I notified all teams from Category 1 earlier this evening. Category 2 teams are being notified as we receive confirmation from FIRST.

I have included a list of all teams that have completed registration below. If your team is not in the list AND you did not get a reminder from me tonight, then you are are Category 2 Team (which means FIRST has not completed processing your payment as of Tuesday, September 25). 

Our plan is to send Qualifier Placement Notices on Oct. 7 at the absolute latest. As a reminder, only those teams who requested a November date have been assigned their qualifier. Everyone else will not be assigned until registration closes. After we assign everyone, you will receive contact and payment information.

Slack Reminder
And don’t forget you can join the FIRST in Alabama Slack: Sign up for our Slack channels! Our Slack is a great tool to use all season for all of our coaches! When you sign up, you will be added to two channels:
* #first-general - This channel is for workspace-wide communication and announcements regarding FIRST® in Alabama.
* #random - A place for non-work-related flimflam, faffing, hodge-podge or jibber-jabber you'd prefer to keep out of more focused work-related channels.

Once in Slack, you will be able to join the other public channels. Our FLL and FLL Jr. specific channels are:
* #fll-general - General discussion for FIRST® LEGO® League in Alabama.
* #fll-project - Discussions regarding the FLL Project Component.
* #fll-robot-game - Discussions regarding the FLL Robot Game Component. This also includes Robot Design and Mission Mat and Models.
* #flljr-general - Community Q&A Regarding FIRST® LEGO® League Jr. in Alabama.

We also have a private channel set up for those teams who will elect to participate in the Open Software Pilot (we’ll add you after registration).

To browse channels or to join a channel, you can find a tutorial here: https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/205239967-Browse-and-join-channels.

Also, there’s a Challenge Update coming out this week, so stay tuned!

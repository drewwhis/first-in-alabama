Hello teams!

It's hard to believe but our local season is quickly wrapping up!

## Regular Season Emails

For most teams, this will be one of the last local emails for the season until after the Challenge state championship or Explore state festival. Most of the information for the rest of the season will be specific to teams participating in those events. We hope you have benefited from this information during the CARGO CONNECT season, and we hope to see you next season!


## Alabama Festival (Explore)

Registration for the 2022 *FIRST*&reg; LEGO&reg; League Explore Alabama Festival is open! The event will be held on Saturday, April 9, 2022, at the von Braun Center in Huntsville, AL. We will be **closing** registration at the end of February, and we currently have five teams registered.

To register, please [use this link](https://forms.gle/76KUBrRMfcq51zRr6).


## Alabama Championship (Challenge)

We currently have 23 spots filled for Championship - which means we have one available. We will be closing Wait List registration on Friday, February 18. We would like to fill all 24 spots if possible, so if your team is interested, please sign up using [this wait list registration form](https://forms.gle/PeqiVvWa8VvJ5PjdA)!

By this point, all registered teams should have received an invoice, a W9, a lunch order form, and other general information. If your team is missing any of this please check with your other team contacts (coaches and team admins especially) to see if they have it. If they don't, please reach out to us.

Hello teams!

We hope everyone enjoyed the past week's holiday and is looking forward to December!

## Qualifiers (Challenge Only)

As of this evening, all only six teams are left to register! We will start placing teams after all teams register or on Friday, December 3, whichever comes first. We still plan to announce qualifier assignments on Tuesday, December 7, so be on the lookout!

Don't forget about the webinar on Saturday, December 4, at noon! We will be covering things to expect on the day of your qualifier and how to best prepare between now and then. We will again hold the webinar on Zoom and record it. To register, visit [the Event Brite page](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/fll-qualifier-prep-tickets-169525217489).


## Remote Scrimmage (Challenge Only)

We will open our virtual scrimmage submissions next Tuesday (December 7)! Between then and January 15, 2022, you will be able to submit two videos for review. The first video will just be you giving us an overview of your table setup and showing how your models work; this will let you make sure you're following the correct build instructions and setting up the table prior to matches correctly. The second video will be your team conducting a full 2.5 minute match just like they would at competition; this video will also require you to record (close-up!) the models on the table when the match is over so we can calculate a score.

This is an optional activity for teams, and we will provide feedback on a rolling basis - the earlier you submit videos, the earlier you'll get feedback! We'll have submission information next week, and *FIRST*&reg; provided [some recording guidelines](https://firstinspiresst01.blob.core.windows.net/first-game-changers/fll-challenge/robot-game-video-recording-doc.pdf) last season that should help!


## DonorsChoose Funding Available   
Thanks to generous support from Disney, educators in the United States can create DonorsChoose projects to fund *FIRST*&reg; in their classrooms. If your team needs additional tools or LEGO resources, [learn more about teacher eligibility and how to create your project](https://info.firstinspires.org/donorschoose-2021).

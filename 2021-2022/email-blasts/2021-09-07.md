Hello teams!

September is here, and we are looking forward to future coach webinars and the *FIRST*&reg; Tech Challenge kickoff on September 18.

## Score Calculator (Challenge Only)

*FIRST*&reg; has made this season's [Score Calculator](https://remotehub.firstinspires.org/scoresheet) available online for anyone to use! It doesn't require a login, and is a great way to double check your mission scores!


## TVA Education Grants

In addition to the TVA grants available for teams, TVA has opened their K-12 STEM grants for the 2021-2022 academic year. Applications are due on October 18. The program funds STEM learning projects in classrooms and schools. Teachers can apply for funding up to \$5,000 for STEM projects with preference given to applications that explore TVAâ€™s primary area of focus: environment, energy, economic and career development, and community problem-solving. Eligible applicants are teachers or school administrators in public or private schools, grades K-12. Schools must be in the TVA service area and receive electricity from a local power distributor served by TVA.

**Be aware** that these grants are not typically awarded until the **end of the academic year**, so they are not going to be much help for the current season (unlike the TVA team grants). If you are interested in pursuing this particular grant for other purposes (or to get ready for the 2022-2023 season), you can view the [application online](https://www.tsin.org/classroom-grants).


## Challenge Webinars (Challenge Only)

Thank you to everyone who joined us for the first webinar - The Innovation Project! This recording (and all future recordings) will be available on [this YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLgAFQNEo9Gn9aLBNm1BQX_8BHWpx40vLS).

Our next webinar, scheduled for Thursday, September 9, at 6:30 PM will address [Team Management in a Remote Environment](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/169023103653). Many teams are starting the year together, and many are not. In this session, we will discuss some best practices to keep your team moving forward when COVID protocols are keeping you apart. If you have questions you would like addressed in a particular session but cannot attend, make sure to complete our [Absentee Question Form](https://forms.gle/GtzrxepfzNgin5NS6)!

The following week, on Thursday, September 16, at 6:30 PM, we will have our [CARGO CONNECT Table Q&A](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/168444910261). For this session, all attendees should first review the [Robot Game Rules](https://firstinspiresst01.blob.core.windows.net/first-forward/fll-challenge/fll-challenge-cargo-connect-robot-game-rulebook.pdf) and the [Challenge Updates](https://firstinspiresst01.blob.core.windows.net/first-forward/fll-challenge/fll-challenge-cargo-connect-challenge-updates.pdf). We also recommend watching our [CARGO CONNECT playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eE9UZNM0Oss&list=PLgAFQNEo9Gn9sJS5w91z1FvumnuAOneEa).

## Guided Mission

For Challenge Teams, don't forget that *FIRST*&reg; and LEGO&reg; have the Guided Mission available for both SPIKE and EV3 teams. For best results, make sure you are using the latest versions of the programming software (2.0.1 for SPIKE, and 1.5.0 for EV3 Classroom). Be aware that the EV3 does not have the Guided Mission in its software units. Refer to the links below to find the right materials.

For the SPIKE, make sure you have SPIKE Prime selected as your device.

In the SPIKE app, you can find the lesson modules under the Units section. The name of the Unit is "Competition Ready." To make sure you're seeing the CARGO CONNECT version, make sure that Lesson 04 is the Guided Mission. If you see that Lesson 08 is the Guided Mission, you are likely seeing the RePLAY lessons. To fix this, go to Settings, then go to General, and click "DELETE ALL UNIT PLANS," then you can re-download the correct version under Units.

You can find the Guided Mission lesson plan [here](https://education.lego.com/en-us/lessons/prime-competition-ready/spike-prime-the-guided-mission#lesson-plan). Keep in mind that it is geared first toward the SPIKE Prime. You can find the SPIKE Prime lesson sequence [here](https://education.lego.com/en-us/lessons/prime-competition-ready), and you can find the EV3 lesson sequences [here](https://firstinspiresst01.blob.core.windows.net/first-forward/fll-challenge/fll-challenge-cargo-connect-ev3-lab-alternative-lesson-sequence.pdf).

You can find the SPIKE Prime robot code [here](https://firstinspiresst01.blob.core.windows.net/first-forward/fll-challenge/fll-spike-prime-guided-mission-air-drop-code.llsp), and you can find the EV3 robot code [here](https://firstinspiresst01.blob.core.windows.net/first-forward/fll-challenge/fll-challenge-cargo-connect-ev3-classroom-guided-mission-air-drop-code.lmsp). These are files that will download that you can open in your programming software.

Please remember that this year is the last year that these resources will be available for the EV3. The EV3 will still be competition legal, but all resources produced for Challenge will be in reference to the SPIKE Prime starting with the 2022-2023 season.

For Explore Teams, you can select the SPIKE Essential in the SPIKE app and go to Units. There you can find the guided lessons for *FIRST*&reg; LEGO&reg; League Explore.

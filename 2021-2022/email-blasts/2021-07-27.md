Hello teams!

With July winding down and August just days away, we know that most of you are already gearing up for the new year. This message is coming out a day early because of some important news!


## TVA Grants - Apply Now!

TVA Grants are available NOW! The grants are available to Challenge and Explore teams in areas served by one of the Tennessee Valley Authority's local power companies. Only teams that have **not** paid for their season registration already are eligible. The grants cover \$130 for Explore teams (registration, Explore Set, tax, and shipping) or \$364 for Challenge teams (registration, Challenge Set, tax, and shipping). To see if your area is eligible, you can view the TVA's list of [partner power companies](https://www.tva.com/energy/public-power-partnerships/local-power-companies).

To apply for the grant, visit the [application page](https://usfirst.submittable.com/submit/1458f43c-4f5c-4e53-99cd-e4ca888522f0/2021-2022-tennessee-valley-authority-team-grant-application).


## Team Member Registration - Challenge and Explore Only

As a reminder, *FIRST*&reg; is requiring all youth team members to officially register with their teams in the online Dashboard. If you plan on attending any official *FIRST*&reg; events this season, this will need to be done for both coaches and all team members.

From *FIRST*&reg;: 
    
    Youth Team Members who have not registered will not be permitted to participate in FIRST remote and in-person team meetings, events, or competitions. 

Fortunately, they have provided detailed steps in the [Youth Registration System Overview](https://www.firstinspires.org/resource-library/youth-registration-system), and we have updated our Frequently Asked Questions pages to point to this resource.

If you have questions or issues registering your team members, you will need to contact *FIRST*&reg; HQ (rather than your local partners). They can be reached by email at firstteammembers@firstinspires.org or by phone at 800-871-8326 (Option “0”  for assistance).


## Remote Mentoring

If your team is starting the year remotely or in a hybrid setting, our remote mentoring training can help you learn more about running safe and inclusive remote meetings, how to build a sense of community for your team, and further resources and support. You can access the training directly [at this link](https://www.firstinspires.org/remote-mentoring-with-first/story.html).

Hello teams!

With the start of October, we're only about a month away from the registration cut-off for *FIRST*&reg; LEGO&reg; League Challenge. If you or someone you know has a potential team, the sooner you register the better!

## Challenge Updates (Challenge Only)

On September 30, *FIRST*&reg; provided a new set of Challenge Updates! There are now 10 total, including the seven from the August 17 batch. Make sure to review all updates with your teams!

The updates are available [here](https://firstinspiresst01.blob.core.windows.net/first-forward/fll-challenge/fll-challenge-cargo-connect-challenge-updates.pdf).


## SPIKE Programming on Chromebooks

If you're using the SPIKE Prime or SPIKE Essential with a Chromebook, you may have noticed issues if you're trying to export and back up your programs. This functionality is currently limited on Chromebooks (but works as expected on PCs, Macs, and iPads). LEGO&reg; is currently working on this, so the full capability should be available soon.

For now, we would recommend not using Chromebooks for your **competition code** just in case something happens right before a big event! There are no other limitations with Chromebooks that we're aware of, just be mindful that you will likely have issues backing up your files.

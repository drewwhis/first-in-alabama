Hello teams!

Welcome to the 2021-2022 season, CARGO CONNECT! Today is Season Launch, and we are super excited to be celebrating with you! This email is a bit more dense than usual (due to Season Launch!), but we expect a more typical message going forward.


## Season Launch Kickoff Event

Don't forget that C.R.A.B. (Cool Robots And Builders) and the Blue Bananas will be hosting a Season Launch Kickoff on Saturday, August 21 from 10 AM to 12 PM (doors open for setup at 9 AM) at the Mark Russell Recreation Center, located at 429 Taylor Road, Big Cove, AL 35763. As an official *FIRST*&reg; event, this kickoff is free and open to the public.

We ask that all teams planning to attend register using [this registration survey](https://forms.gle/htdQz3w62CCjzNRPA) no later than Thursday!

As a reminder, youth team members **must** [be registered in the Dashboard](https://www.firstinspires.org/resource-library/youth-registration-system) to attend with a team.

In order to minimize risk, we are requiring individuals in attendance to wear a mask, and we will be doing temperature checks at the door with wristbands for those who have been checked.


## CARGO CONNECT Season Launch

Though the Challenge and Explore videos have been released, there are a handful of documents you'll want to start reading **immediately** along with your team. **The information presented in the Season Launch video(s) is not enough to plan your season!**

We will try to note as many official resources here as possible!

For Challenge teams (especially) you have **A LOT** of information to cover. For the next day, we recommend watching the videos from *FIRST*&reg; ASAP! Then we suggest *making a plan* for how you'll cover all of the information needed for yourself and your students. You do not have to have everything memorized this week!

Also for Challenge teams, *FIRST*&reg; has already released several (minor) [Challenge Updates](https://firstinspiresst01.blob.core.windows.net/first-forward/fll-challenge/fll-challenge-cargo-connect-challenge-updates.pdf)! Make sure you review these **with your Robot Game Rules**.

## CARGO CONNECT Videos for the Alabama Region (Challenge Only)

Your Program Delivery Partners and *FIRST*&reg; Senior Mentor have spent the past few weeks recording, editing, and reviewing a series of videos to provide some commentary and additional explanation of *FIRST*&reg; LEGO&reg; League Challenge and the rules/missions for CARGO CONNECT.

In total there are **38** videos, mostly between two and seven minutes long.
- Three (3) videos with an overview of FLL Challenge.
- One (1) video explaining the various documents.
- Eight (8) videos covering all 26 rules in the Robot Game Rules.
- One (1) video covering topics that are New This Year.
- One (1) video with corrections. Make sure to watch this one before the ones that come after!
- Five (5) videos covering the table overview and setup.
- Eighteen (18) videos covering each mission's scoring and setup.
- One (1) wrap-up video. 

We will add notes in the descriptions as the season progresses based on feedback and season updates. The videos are intended for coaches primarily, but you are free to share them with parents and students, especially the overview videos. We hope they will provide you and your team members with better clarity about the program and this season.

The videos can be watched in any order, but I do recommend watching the Corrections video before watching the table and missions videos. The corrections include:
- Setting up Mission M14 (Bridge). The center piece should be placed hollow side UP, not down as the original videos claim.

The videos are all listed in [this playlist on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLgAFQNEo9Gn9sJS5w91z1FvumnuAOneEa).

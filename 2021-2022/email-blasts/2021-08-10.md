Hello teams!

It's almost here! This is the LAST EMAIL before Season Launch, so don't forget to join the global community at 11 AM Central (12:00 Noon Eastern) on August 17, next Tuesday! In this time before Season Launch, we recommend reviewing our [email archive](https://github.com/drewwhis/alabama-first-lego-league/tree/main/2021-2022/email-blasts) for the current season. As always, feel free to reach out with any questions you might have!


## Season Launch Kickoff Event

Don't forget that C.R.A.B. (Cool Robots And Builders) and the Blue Bananas will be hosting a Season Launch Kickoff on Saturday, August 21 from 10 AM to 12 PM (doors open for setup at 9 AM) at the Mark Russell Recreation Center, located at 429 Taylor Road, Big Cove, AL 35763. As an official *FIRST*&reg; event, this kickoff is free and open to the public.

Coaches, students, teachers, and parents are welcome to attend. Team members **must** [be registered in the Dashboard](https://www.firstinspires.org/resource-library/youth-registration-system) to attend with a team. Coaches and students must complete their 2021-2022 Consent and Release form in the Dashboard. All other attendees will be able to complete a paper form upon arrival, and any non-team members under 18 must attend with a parent or guardian to complete a form.

We would like to keep a running estimate of attendees, so we ask all teams to complete [this registration survey](https://forms.gle/htdQz3w62CCjzNRPA) if attending. Only one person per team needs to complete the form, and you can use one entry for multiple teams!

The event will require individuals in attendance to wear a mask, and we will be doing temperature checks at the door with wristbands after to watch for anyone we might miss. This was the policy used at the South Carolina Robotics and Practical off-season *FIRST*&reg; Robotics Competition event in Columbia, South Carolina this past weekend, and everything ran smoothly for three entire days of competition!


## Challenge and Explore Events

We are starting to plan out the events for the 2021-2022 season, but we don't have a ton of information to share just yet.

For Explore, we are planning for one, statewide event to coincide with the *FIRST*&reg; Robotics Competition Regional in Alabama, which will be one Saturday between February and April 2022. We will share that date when it has been posted!

For Challenge, we are looking at a timeline of late January to early February for our qualifying tournaments. Those events are contingent upon having enough teams in the state to warrant qualifiers, so we'll be watching registration numbers until late October before we make that final decision. We are currently looking at venues, but it is still **heavily** dependent upon how many teams are in the state and where they are located. We are aiming for the Alabama Championship to take place in late February to early March.

As of today, we are planning toward **totally in-person** events, which is part of the reason for the late and somewhat loose timeline. If the situation in the spring has not improved, we would look at transitioning the qualifiers to virtual events first, then reevaluate for the state tournament. Again, the goal is wholly in-person events, and we think that goal is absolutely attainable **under the right circumstances**.


## Challenge Rule and Mission Videos

We've been at work over the past couple of weeks to get some videos ready! These videos are aimed toward coaches, though they are also appropriate for team members and parents. The videos provide some analysis and explanation of: *FIRST*&reg; LEGO League Challenge, table setup for this season, robot rules for this season, and missions for this season. We hope that they will provide you with insights beyond what you might take from a cursory reading of the rules and that it will curtail some confusion for new and veteran coaches.

Those videos will go live shortly after Season Launch **NEXT WEEK** with a link in the weekly email and a post in the Discord.


## Grants

Several grant opportunities are available right now for teams via the [Grant Locator Tool](https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/team-grants). These grants may cover registration fees (for Challenge and Explore Teams) and/or Challenge or Explore sets!

One such grant is the TVA grant for teams in areas serviced by one of TVA's [partner power companies](https://www.tva.com/energy/public-power-partnerships/local-power-companies). Some teams have already been notified that they've been awarded grants, so you should apply ASAP! One coach has reported that from her application submission to fund dispersal was about 15 days.

Hello teams!

With June officially on the way out and July starting this week, we are moving ever closer to the start of *FIRST*&reg; FORWARD and CARGO CONNECT!


## Returning Teams (Dashboard Action!)

With the start of the new season fast-approaching, we encourage all Challenge and Explore teams that plan on participating this season to indicate their returning status! These steps only apply if you have teams currently in your Dashboard that you can make changes to.

In your Dashboard, on the My Teams tab, there is a button labeled Returning Teams. If you click on that button, it will pull up a list of all teams you can modify!

For each team you know is returning, check the box next to the team, then click the Submit button. You can modify this list later, too! So if you're responsible for five teams but only know that two are returning now, you can submit that information!

Filling out the form is **not** a commitment, and it does not charge you anything. You are also not penalized for changing a team's status later (in either direction) if you have not yet paid your registration fees.


## Thinkscape

Did you know that every team and Class Pack registration (both Challenge and Explore!) gets you access to resources in Thinkscape? Thinkscape hosts modules for lessons (sort of like an online course), with educator and student versions of each module. You can also find digital versions of the guidebooks and other season-specific materials. The season-specific resources will be available after the new season launches in August.

For information on accessing your Thinkscape resources, check [this Challenge document](https://info.firstinspires.org/hubfs/Education_Resources/thinkscape/FLLChallenge-Teams-Thinkscape-Access.pdf) or [this Explore document](https://info.firstinspires.org/hubfs/Education_Resources/thinkscape/FLLExplore-Teams-Thinkscape-Access.pdf). The instructions should be similar.

Be aware that you must have paid your team or Class Pack registration to access the resources. If you have both teams and Class Packs, there are different Thinkscape resources for each!


## YPP Renewal

Every adult directly involved in *FIRST*&reg; (volunteers, mentors, coaches) is subject to the Youth Protection Screening background checks. These checks must be updated every four years, and now is a good time to verify your status! To check your status:
- Log into your Dashboard.
- Click on the menu in the upper-right corner (where your name is visible).
- Choose the Youth Protection Screening option.

In the lower-right corner, you should see your name, your screening status, and the expiration date of your most recent valid screening. From this page, you should also be able to complete a new screening. To learn more about the Youth Protection Policy or to contact *FIRST*&reg;, visit the [Youth Protection Program page](https://www.firstinspires.org/resource-library/youth-protection-policy) in the Resource Library.

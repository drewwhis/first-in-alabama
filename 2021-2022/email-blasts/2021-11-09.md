## Qualifier Preparation (Challenge Only)

In order to help prepare our teams for their upcoming qualifiers, we have a few opportunities planned.

The first is a webinar, to be held on Saturday, December 4, at noon. We will be covering things to expect on the day of your qualifier and how to best prepare between now and then. We will again hold the webinar on Zoom and record it. To register, visit [the Event Brite page](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/fll-qualifier-prep-tickets-169525217489).

We are also planning for some remote scrimmage opportunities in early January 2022. We hope to have more information to share next week!


## Festival Registration (Explore Only)

For our Explore Teams, there are two big events you'll want to track. All Alabama teams will be invited to participate in the *FIRST*&reg; LEGO&reg; League Explore Alabama Festival to be held on Saturday, April 9, 2022 at the von Braun Center in Huntsville, AL. We will open the registration for that event in January 2022.

We are also anticipating an invitation to the *FIRST*&reg; LEGO&reg; League Explore World Festival to be held as part of the *FIRST*&reg; Championship in Houston, TX, from April 20 to April 23, 2022. If our region is awarded a spot, we will lottery among our teams attending the Alabama Festival. Again, we hope to have more information in January!

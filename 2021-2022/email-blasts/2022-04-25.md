Hello teams!

The *FIRST*&reg; Championship wrapped up on Saturday, April 23, 2022, officially closing the 2021-2022 season CARGO CONNECT<sup>SM</sup> and *FIRST*&reg; FORWARD<sup>SM</sup> presented by Qualcomm.

We would like to thank everyone who joined us for the past season in our Discover, Explore, and Challenge divisions! We would also like to congratulate C.R.A.B. (Cool Robots and Builders) for representing the Alabama region at the *FIRST*&reg; LEGO&reg; League Challenge World Festival and bringing back an Innovation Project Finalist Award. We would also like to wish the best of luck to the Blue Bananas and Fast Photons as they prepare for the Razorback Invitational in May.

It's only a matter of days before registration for the new season opens up. The 2022-2023 season *FIRST*&reg; ENERGIZE<sup>SM</sup> presented by Qualcomm will feature SUPERPOWERED<sup>SM</sup> in which *FIRST* LEGO League teams will explore where energy comes from and how it is distributed, stored, and used – and then put their superpowered creativity to work to innovate for a better energy future. You can check your [*FIRST* Dashboard](https://my.firstinspires.org/Dashboard/) to register for the new season **sometime after** May 18, 2022. Watch for updates regarding the new season's registration launch!

In preparation for the new season, you may want to review our [Frequently Asked Questions](https://github.com/drewwhis/alabama-first-lego-league/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions), including:
- [How do I leave a team?](https://github.com/drewwhis/alabama-first-lego-league/wiki/Leaving-a-Team)
- [How do I add a new team?](https://github.com/drewwhis/alabama-first-lego-league/wiki/Adding-a-NEW-Team)
- [How do I register an existing team?](https://github.com/drewwhis/alabama-first-lego-league/wiki/Register-an-EXISTING-Team)

Please remember that you cannot register new or existing teams for the new season until the Dashboard opens for new season registration **in mid-to-late May**. Also be aware that leaving all of your *FIRST* LEGO League teams will remove you from our mailing list. We also do not advise leaving a team until after registration opens for the new season.

Thank you again for joining us this season, and we hope to see you at a SUPERPOWERED event during *FIRST* ENERGIZE.

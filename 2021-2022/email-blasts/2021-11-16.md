Hello teams!

We know that many of you are preparing for your Thanksgiving breaks next week, so we hope you all enjoy the extended time off!

## Qualifier Registration (Challenge Only)

At this point, we've contacted all of our registered Challenge teams with registration information for events! If your team is registered and secured with *FIRST*&reg;, make sure to check with the other contacts for your team. Don't forget the registration deadline is December 3, 2021!


## Qualifier Preparation (Challenge Only)

In order to help prepare our teams for their upcoming qualifiers, we have a few opportunities planned.

The first is a webinar, to be held on Saturday, December 4, at noon. We will be covering things to expect on the day of your qualifier and how to best prepare between now and then. We will again hold the webinar on Zoom and record it. To register, visit [the Event Brite page](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/fll-qualifier-prep-tickets-169525217489).

We are also planning for some remote scrimmage opportunities in early January 2022. We hope to have more information to share next week!


## Holiday Gift Ideas

The [*FIRST*&reg; Store](https://first.corpmerchandise.com) has a lot of great gift ideas available, and you can get 15% off all orders between **November 29** and **December 3**. Just use the code **SAVE15** on checkout.

We're both personally big fans of the CARGO CONNECT t-shirt, but there's plenty to choose from!

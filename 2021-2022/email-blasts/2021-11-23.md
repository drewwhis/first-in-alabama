Hello teams!

We hope you enjoy your Thanksgiving holiday this week!

## Qualifier Registration (Challenge Only)

As of this evening, all only six teams are left to register! We realize many people won't be responding to email right now, and we don't blame you! As we mentioned previously, the preference deadline is Friday, December 3, but we will try to release the results sooner if all teams register in time!

We are also excited to announce that the Alabama region has **officially** received an invitation to the *FIRST*&reg; LEGO&reg; League Challenge World Festival in Houston, TX, meaning that the Champion's Award winner at the Alabama Championship will represent our region in post-season play!


## Qualifier Preparation (Challenge Only)

In order to help prepare our teams for their upcoming qualifiers, we have a few opportunities planned.

The first is a webinar, to be held on Saturday, December 4, at noon. We will be covering things to expect on the day of your qualifier and how to best prepare between now and then. We will again hold the webinar on Zoom and record it. To register, visit [the Event Brite page](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/fll-qualifier-prep-tickets-169525217489).

We will also have a remote scrimmage opportunity! Any Challenge team will be able to submit videos of their table setup and one full match. The video of your table setup will allow us to provide you feedback to ensure that your table has the correct setup used in competitions, and the video of your full 2.5 minute match will let you get feedback on things that may trip you up in competition. We will be sending more information next week.


## DonorsChoose Funding Available   
Thanks to generous support from Disney, educators in the United States can create DonorsChoose projects to fund *FIRST*&reg; in their classrooms. If your team needs additional tools or LEGO resources, [learn more about teacher eligibility and how to create your project](https://info.firstinspires.org/donorschoose-2021).

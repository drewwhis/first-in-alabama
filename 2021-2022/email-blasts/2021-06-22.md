Hello teams!

It's hard to believe that June is almost over! We've already received our Explore set and have placed the order for our Challenge set, so we know release day is coming soon!


## *FIRST*&reg; Home STEM Series

For those looking for activities to prepare for the upcoming year, *FIRST*&reg; has the [*FIRST*&reg; at Home curriculum series](https://info.firstinspires.org/at-home-stem-curriculum-series). Many of the activities are organized by age group, so make sure to give it a look!


## Regranting

If your team has funds available in your Dashboard from a past year, you have until **June 30th** to request a regrant! This only applies to a small number of teams each year, so make sure to check your Dashboard ASAP to see if you have funds available for a regrant.

To learn more about the regrant process, visit [this page](https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/regranting-process-procedures-and-w-9).

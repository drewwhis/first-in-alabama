Hello teams!

We are excited for the second week of remote qualifiers this week!

## Remote Qualifiers (Challenge)

We would like to congratulate all teams who participated in the Southern Railway Qualifier this past weekend! You can view the [results on this page](https://github.com/drewwhis/first-in-alabama/blob/main/2021-2022/challenge-results.md).

We would also like to remind all teams to make sure your team name is up-to-date in your *FIRST*&reg; Dashboard. We have instructions on our [FAQ page](https://github.com/drewwhis/first-in-alabama/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions).

For those competing this weekend, we sent all qualifier information to all teams on Friday, January 21. Some of you may be missing one or more emails for one or more teams - please let us know ASAP if you didn't get one (and be sure to include the team number)!

Please check your qualifier email for all important details. Also, please make sure that each round uses a different configuration for Mission 10 (there are six possible, so you only need three).

Finally, make sure all of your documents are uploaded by the deadline for your event!

Hello teams!

It's hard to believe that we are less than a month away from Season Launch! Make sure to tune in on August 17 at 11:00 AM Central Daylight Time (that's 12:00 PM EDT).


## Mentoring and Coaching Training

*FIRST*&reg; mentors and coaches provide *FIRST*&reg; students with inclusive environments to learn and thrive. Our free cross-program training module is designed to help new and prospective coaches and mentors better understand their roles and where to find support.

The training lasts about 20 minutes and offers an overview of *FIRST*&reg; and additional resources from the perspective of multiple programs, including the three *FIRST*&reg; LEGO&reg; League divisions, *FIRST*&reg; Tech Challenge, and *FIRST*&reg; Robotics Competition. Choosing your program will gear the training more appropriately to you.

The training is directly accessible [here](https://www.firstinspires.org/mentoring-and-coaching/story.html).


## Retired Game Pieces and Elements

AndyMark is a supporter of *FIRST*&reg; and has been a supplier of components and robot elements for *FIRST*&reg; Tech Challenge and *FIRST*&reg; Robotics Competition for several years.

The company has recently begun offering components for *FIRST*&reg; LEGO&reg; League Challenge and Explore teams. We've talked about the robot competition table before (that we will be using at the state championship!), but they are also selling past Challenge and Explore sets! These may be especially helpful for rookie teams looking for extra practice or experience. Supplies are limited (as these sets are from prior seasons), so be aware!

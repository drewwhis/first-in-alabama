Hello teams!

We know that many schools have wrapped (or are close to wrapping) up their first quarters, so we'd like to wish everyone good luck as we move into the second half of the fall semester!


## STEAMfest - Teams Needed!

Huntsville is hosting a STEAMfest on October 30th at the von Braun Center from 10 AM to 6 PM (9 AM load-in).  We have space for all the *FIRST*&reg; programs to showcase at the event. We are bringing an FLL Challenge field and have *FIRST*&reg; materials to share. 

If you would like to participate, please contact Jamie McClung at jmcclung@firstinspires.org. You are welcome to come for a period of time to showcase your team.


## Upcoming Event Registration

We'd like to share a brief update regarding event registration!

For our Explore teams, the Alabama Festival will be held on Saturday, April 9, at the von Braun Center in Huntsville, AL. We will be opening registration for this event in January 2022.

For our Challenge teams, we hope to have our qualifier locations finalized by the end of the month. By mid-November we should see the close of **team** registration so we can open up **event** registration. Our goal is to have all teams assigned to qualifiers by the second week in December. As a reminder, we are currently planning for qualifiers in **late January** or **early February** with the state championship in March. We do **not** have firm dates or locations to share at this time. As a reminder for returning teams (and a piece of advice for new teams), we **cannot** guarantee that your team will get a spot at any particular event, but we do guarantee that you will get a spot and we will try to maximize team preferences to the best of our abilities. We are anticipating approximately ten teams per event. We hope to have additional information in the next two to three weeks.


## In-Progress Team Registration (**Time Sensitive**)

As a reminder, all teams must be registered with *FIRST*&reg; prior to the **team** registration deadline (in early November for Challenge, in early 2022 for Explore). This includes paying your fee (\$225 for Challenge, \$99 for Explore). Teams that have not paid these fees at the close of registration will **not** be eligible to register for events.

In addition, all teams participating in official events must have all students registered in the *FIRST*&reg; Dashboard. Fortunately, they have provided detailed steps in the [Youth Registration System Overview](https://www.firstinspires.org/resource-library/youth-registration-system), and we have updated our Frequently Asked Questions pages to point to this resource.

If you have questions or issues registering your team members, you will need to contact *FIRST*&reg; HQ (rather than your local partners). They can be reached by email at firstteammembers@firstinspires.org or by phone at 800-871-8326 (Option “0”  for assistance). If you have not completed this process yet, you should start as soon as possible!


## *FIRST*&reg; Mentor Network

Many teams can always use more help from mentors, and *FIRST*&reg; offers a tool to help match your team with available mentors. You can learn how to sign your team up with the [*FIRST*&reg; Mentor Network](https://info.firstinspires.org/mentor-network) and start looking for mentors today! As of this writing, the program is setup primarily for virtual mentoring, so many potential matches won't be available to meet in-person with your team.

Hello teams!

August is here, and Season Launch is only TWO WEEKS AWAY! Don't forget to join the global community at 11 AM Cental (12:00 Noon Eastern) on August 17! We know that many of you are getting back to school, and we hope to get you caught up with anything you might have missed! In this time before Season Launch, we recommend reviewing our [email archive](https://github.com/drewwhis/first-in-alabama/tree/main/2021-2022/email-blasts) for the current season. As always, feel free to reach out with any questions you might have!


## CARGO CONNECT Kickoff Event

We are excited to announce a kickoff event in North Alabama for the CARGO CONNECT season! The event will be hosted by C.R.A.B. (Cool Robots And Builders) and the Blue Bananas! Members from *FIRST*&reg; in Alabama, including the Program Delivery Partners, will also be in attendance.

Here, teams will have the opportunity to meet other teams, show off their RePLAY robot and Innovation Project, and much more! As a season kickoff event, you will be able to view the season launch video, and we will have a fully assembled CARGO CONNECT field on display (and we will be available for questions).

Coaches, students, teachers, and parents are welcome to attend. Team members **must** [be registered in the Dashboard](https://www.firstinspires.org/resource-library/youth-registration-system) to attend with a team. Coaches and students must complete their 2021-2022 Consent and Release form in the Dashboard. All other attendees will be able to complete a paper form upon arrival, and any non-team members under 18 must attend with a parent or guardian to complete a form.

The event will be held on Saturday, August 21 from 10 AM to 12 PM (doors open for setup at 9 AM) at the Mark Russell Recreation Center, located at 429 Taylor Road, Big Cove, AL 35763. As an official *FIRST*&reg; event, this kickoff is free and open to the public.

We would like to keep a running estimate of attendees, so we ask all teams to complete [this registration survey](https://forms.gle/htdQz3w62CCjzNRPA) if attending. Only one person per team needs to complete the form, and you can use one entry for multiple teams!

As always, be sure to follow any local ordinances regarding event safety, and we will also be keeping up to date with the latest guidelines from *FIRST*&reg;, following the most the stringent guidelines where a discrepancy occurs.


## TVA Grants

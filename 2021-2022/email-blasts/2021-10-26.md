Hello teams!

This is the last email for the month of October! Things are going to move very quickly over the next two months before the winter break, so please reach out ASAP if there's anything we can help with! Don't forget to review the [email archive](https://github.com/drewwhis/first-in-alabama/tree/main/2021-2022/email-blasts) if you think you missed anything.


## STEAMfest - DEADLINE

Huntsville is hosting a STEAMfest on October 30th at the von Braun Center from 10 AM to 6 PM (9 AM load-in).  We have space for all the *FIRST*&reg; programs to showcase at the event. We are bringing an FLL Challenge field and have *FIRST*&reg; materials to share. 

If you would like to participate, please contact Jamie McClung at jmcclung@firstinspires.org ASAP! You are welcome to come for a period of time to showcase your team.


## Challenge Updates (Challenge Only)

There was a new [Challenge Update](https://firstinspiresst01.blob.core.windows.net/first-forward/fll-challenge/fll-challenge-cargo-connect-challenge-updates.pdf) posted on October 21. Make sure to check it out!

*FIRST*&reg; also updated the [Participation Rules](https://firstinspiresst01.blob.core.windows.net/first-forward/fll-challenge/fll-challenge-participation-rules.pdf) for FLL Challenge. Make sure you review this document carefully!


## Event Updates (Challenge Only)

We're ready to share a bit more information on events for FLL Challenge teams! We will have qualifiers on Saturday, January 29, 2022, and on Saturday, February 5, 2022. We don't have all of the locations ready to announce yet or which events or on which day, but I anticipate that information within the next week. Again, we cannot guarantee any event or day to any team when we open registration, but we will do our best to maximize team preferences.

We **are** ready to announce that the *FIRST*&reg; LEGO&reg; League Challenge Alabama Championship will be held on Saturday March 5, 2022, in Fort Payne, Alabama, hosted by *FIRST*&reg; Robotics Competition Team 7428 - The Gigawatts! This will actually be a dual event and will also feature the *FIRST*&reg; Tech Challenge Alabama Championship simultaneously! We look forward to sharing more information about this event with everyone, including the 24 teams that will advance from their qualifiers.

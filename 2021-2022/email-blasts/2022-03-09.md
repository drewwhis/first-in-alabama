Hello Challenge Teams!

It's hard to believe, but the Alabama CARGO CONNECT season has come to a close for our division! We'll probably have one more program-wide email after this one, and the new season will open in May.


## *FIRST*&reg; in Alabama and *FIRST*&reg; Events

There are two more events in Alabama this season. The *FIRST*&reg; Robotics Competition Rocket City Regional takes place in Huntsville, AL, from April 7 to April 9, with April 6 for setup. The event is in need of a variety of volunteer roles, and there are single- and multiple-day roles available. If you're interested, or know someone who might be, we have [role descriptions](https://www.firstinspires.org/resource-library/frc/volunteer-event-roles-and-training-resources) and [sign-up information](https://www.firstinspires.org/sites/default/files/uploads/resource_library/volunteer/frc-event-volunteer-instructions.pdf).

On the Saturday of that event (April 9), we will be hosting the *FIRST*&reg; LEGO&reg; League Explore Alabama Festival at the same location! This is the culminating season event for teams in the FLL Explore division (ages 6-10). Both events are free and open to the public to attend.

Outside of Alabama, the *FIRST*&reg; Championship in Houston, TX, takes place from April 18 to April 23, with Monday and Tuesday being setup days. Most volunteer roles start on Wednesday evening or Thursday morning, and all programs (FLL Explore, FLL Challenge, FTC, and FRC) will be on full display! It's a fun experience as a volunteer, and there are workshops on site, so it's an easy case to make as a professional development opportunity.


## Alabama Championship Results

We have updated our [Challenge Results page](https://github.com/drewwhis/alabama-first-lego-league/blob/main/2021-2022/challenge-results.md) to reflect the results of the *FIRST*&reg; LEGO&reg; League Challenge Alabama Championship, including robot game scores and awards. We would like to thank everyone who participated this season and everyone who was able to attend with us. At this time, all participating teams should have received their rubrics, as well; please let us know if there are any issues, as the transcription process has proven a bit quirky this season.

We would especially like to congratulate those teams representing Alabama in future competitions - the Blue Bananas attending the Razorback Invitational in Arkansas and C.R.A.B. (Cool Robots and Builders) attending the *FIRST*&reg; LEGO&reg; League Challenge World Festival in Houston, Texas.


## Key Dates

Thank you all again for joining us for the CARGO CONNECT season! The new season is right around the corner, though! Shortly after the *FIRST*&reg; Championship will be the sneak peak of the 2022-2023 season! Team registration will follow by opening in May 2022, and we anticipate the season reveal in early August.

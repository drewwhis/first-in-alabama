Hello teams!

We hope you had a relaxing holiday weekend and are gearing up for the new season like we are!

## Webinar Surveys

We are currently considering hosting weekly or biweekly webinars for our coaches, both in Explore and Challenge. These would be 30-60 minute video calls every week or every other week where we present on a topic our coaches are interested in.

These would be partially conversational, involving the Program Delivery Partners, the *FIRST*&reg; Senior Mentor, and possibly the *FIRST*&reg; VISTAs, depending on the topic. The sessions would also include Q&A from participants and would be recorded for upload.

In order to plan properly, we want to gauge interest and solicit topic ideas! We have two surveys linked below, one for Challenge teams and one for Explore teams. If you only have one type of team, you only need to complete the form for that program division. If you have both Challenge and Explore teams, we ask that you complete both forms, responding specifically for each program. Once we have a good understanding of interest and topics, we'll release a schedule of webinars (if there's enough interest).

For **Challenge** Teams, complete [this form](https://forms.gle/2UybN7aWuHkuhDvo9).

For **Explore** Teams, complete [this form](https://forms.gle/ydjgjRVDLNA2Hi9e7).

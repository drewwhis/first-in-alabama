Hello teams!

It's already been a whole week since Season Launch! We would like to thank everyone who was able to attend the kickoff event this past Saturday, and we would especially like to thank C.R.A.B. (Cool Robots and Builders) and the Blue Bananas for hosting! We encourage teams to keep up with the latest Challenge updates and documents from *FIRST*&reg; for all three divisions of *FIRST*&reg; LEGO&reg; League! We have also added a [new video](https://youtu.be/4nXGr1ps8vA) addressing the first wave of Challenge Updates for Challenge teams.


## ThinkScape Access

Now that the season has kicked off, you should have full access to your Thinkscape modules! These modules are available to all Challenge and Explore Teams (and Challenge, Explore, and Discover ClassPacks!) that have paid their registration fees to *FIRST*&reg;. In Thinkscape, you'll find plenty of tools and resources, including digital copies of the Engineering Notebook and Team Meeting Guide!

For information on accessing your Thinkscape resources, check [this Challenge document](https://info.firstinspires.org/hubfs/Education_Resources/thinkscape/FLLChallenge-Teams-Thinkscape-Access.pdf) or [this Explore document](https://info.firstinspires.org/hubfs/Education_Resources/thinkscape/FLLExplore-Teams-Thinkscape-Access.pdf). The instructions should be similar.

Be aware that you must have paid your team or Class Pack registration to access the resources. If you have both teams and Class Packs, there are different Thinkscape resources for each!


## Challenge Webinars

We are planning our first webinar for Challenge coaches to be held on Thursday, September 2, at 6:30 P.M. (Central Daylight Time)! These sessions will be geared toward coaches and held over Zoom. We will also be recording them and uploading them to our YouTube channel. All participants must complete their Consent and Release Forms from *FIRST*&reg;.

To complete your Consent and Release Form, follow [these instructions](https://github.com/drewwhis/alabama-first-lego-league/wiki/Complete-the-Consent-and-Release-Form). After you complete the form once, you're good for the rest of the season! 

After completing the Consent and Release Form, you can register to attend [using this link](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/the-innovation-project-tickets-168311551381). Most sessions will feature some form of Question and Answer forum, so the more attendees we have, the more content that will be generated!

The topic for this first session is the Innovation Project! *FIRST*&reg; LEGO&reg; League Challenge is, as I like to say, very specifically **not** a robotics competition. While our teams build robots to score points, that is only one aspect of our program. Just as important is the Innovation Project - an opportunity for your students to identify and SOLVE a real-world problem! In this session, we will talk about the requirements for the Innovation Project while addressing some best practices and answering your questions!

If you're unable to attend in person, but have specific questions you would like addressed, please fill out our [Absentee Question Form](https://forms.gle/dV9mNk4RdEcohx387) no later than Wednesday, September 1. The form will ask for an email address so we can follow up if we need to clarify anything!

We currently have enough content planned for around eight to ten webinars, but feel free to send requests!


## Team Registration and Events

As a reminder, we are currently planning for these, in-person events: Challenge Qualifier (late January to early February), Challenge State Championship (March), and Explore State Expo (March to April). We are also planning a series of COVID mitigation strategies, with varying levels of in-person participation, even down to fully remote events. We will have a better picture of what exactly these events will look like closer to time.

We are still only tentatively planning for Challenge Qualifiers because we currently do not have enough teams registered to warrant qualifying events. We are currently exploring potential host sites, and we will make the final determination in November once registration closes. Again, we are planning for qualifiers for the Challenge division, but we will make the final call once we know how many teams are registered.


## SPIKE Essential Kit - Explore Only

Some of you may have seen, but LEGO&reg; has announced the release of a new product - the SPIKE Essential! This product is the new solution for *FIRST*&reg; LEGO&reg; League Explore, replacing the WeDo 2.0 system. Like the original WeDo before it, the WeDo 2.0 is still legal for all *FIRST*&reg; LEGO&reg; League Explore teams, and will remain so for the foreseeable future. All materials provided to Explore teams starting with the 2022-2023 season will use the SPIKE Essential primarily, though, so keep this in mind.

One huge benefit of the SPIKE Essential is that it uses the same parts, motors, and sensors as the SPIKE Prime system used in Challenge. You even use the same software to program them! It's a great tool for organizations providing a progression of *FIRST*&reg; LEGO&reg; League programs. You can learn more about the SPIKE Essential kit from [this LEGO&reg; website](https://education.lego.com/en-us/products/lego-education-spike-essential-set/45345#spike™-essential).

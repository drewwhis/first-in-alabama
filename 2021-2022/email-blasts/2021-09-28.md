Hello teams!

We've reached the end of September, which means the team registration deadline is rapidly approaching! Once we get a better idea of our team registrations, we'll be more prepared to announce events.


## Challenge Webinar - This Week (Challenge Only)

This week is our last currently scheduled webinar, and it's a big one - [Preparing Your Team For Judging](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/168632082097)! The session will be held on 30 September 2021 at 6:30 PM. We'll go over the judging process and feature a panel of guest judges and Champions Award-winning coaches! It and all other webinars will be available on [this YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLgAFQNEo9Gn9aLBNm1BQX_8BHWpx40vLS).

Remember that anyone wishing to attend **must** complete their Consent and Release form with *FIRST*&reg; prior to attending ([details here](https://github.com/drewwhis/alabama-first-lego-league/wiki/Complete-the-Consent-and-Release-Form)). If you have questions you would like addressed in a particular session but cannot attend, make sure to complete our [Absentee Question Form](https://forms.gle/GtzrxepfzNgin5NS6)!


## SPIKE Tutorial Videos

With the transition to the LEGO&reg; SPIKE tools for Challenge and Explore, we're going to start posting some how-to videos for specific tasks with the software. We'll be posting them on our [SPIKE Tutorial playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLgAFQNEo9Gn9qD9xME8pYlkvQYr1HT4dM). If you have any topic requests, please reach out! Our goal is to tackle brief (ideally under five-minute) tasks, but we're happy to consider larger requests!


## Team Participation Certificates

We encourage our teams to celebrate what their members have accomplished! *FIRST*&reg; has provided certificate templates that our teams can use both to celebrate these achievements and to act as keepsakes to remember their time in the program.

The [Challenge certificates](https://firstinspiresst01.blob.core.windows.net/first-forward/fll-challenge/cargo-connect-challenge-certificates.zip) and the [Explore certificates](https://firstinspiresst01.blob.core.windows.net/first-forward/fll-explore/cargo-connect-explore-certificates.zip) are available for download now!

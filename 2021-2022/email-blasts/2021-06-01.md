Hello teams!

With June upon us and the official start of summer only a couple of weeks away, we know that many of you have entered full vacation mode! Our emails will continue through the summer months, but we do maintain our [email archive](https://github.com/drewwhis/first-in-alabama/tree/main/2021-2022/email-blasts) where you can quickly find every email from the current season.

We do recommend checking for our emails weekly (either in your email or on the GitHub) so that you will be aware of any grant opportunities that pop up between now and the start of the academic year!

## Team Member Registration - Challenge and Explore Only

*FIRST*&reg; is requiring all youth team members to officially register with their teams in the online Dashboard.

From *FIRST*&reg;: 
    
    Youth Team Members who have not registered will not be permitted to participate in FIRST remote and in-person team meetings, events, or competitions. 

Fortunately, they have provided detailed steps in the [Youth Registration System Overview](https://www.firstinspires.org/resource-library/youth-registration-system), and we have updated our Frequently Asked Questions pages to point to this resource.

If you have questions or issues registering your team members, you will need to contact *FIRST*&reg; HQ (rather than your local partners). They can be reached by email at firstteammembers@firstinspires.org or by phone at 800-871-8326 (Option “0”  for assistance).


## EV3 Software Upgrade - Challenge Only

We have already shared that the LEGO&reg; MINDSTORMS EV3 is being retired in summer 2021 (but it is still competition legal!), but you may need to upgrade your programming software if you're using it for the upcoming season. If your team is using the new LEGO&reg; SPIKE Prime, this software update does **not** impact you.

The old EV3 software (known as EV3 Lab) was retired in March 2021 from most platforms and replaced with the newer EV3 Classroom. You can download the new software [at this link](https://education.lego.com/en-us/downloads/mindstorms-ev3/software).

We recommend installing the software on a different computer while you are upgrading in case there are compatibility issues with your old programs. We also recommend upgrading as soon as possible so you have the most time for your students to acclimate to the new software.

You can learn more about the EV3 retirement on [our wiki page](https://github.com/drewwhis/first-in-alabama/wiki/EV3-Retirement).


## Useful Links

We've been working to expand the wiki pages on our GitHub beyond just the [Frequently Asked Questions](https://github.com/drewwhis/first-in-alabama/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions). We've also centralized the [Program Information](https://github.com/drewwhis/first-in-alabama/wiki/FIRST-LEGO-League) there as well.

We're adding a new section for [Useful Links](https://github.com/drewwhis/first-in-alabama/wiki/Useful-Links). We hope to centralize all of the official sites from *FIRST*&reg; and LEGO&reg; into this section, so make sure to check there frequently! If you have any suggestions for the useful links, please let us know. Right now, we're planning on using it for official resources, but we are also considering an unofficial resources area.

Each program also has a Resource Library linked in our Useful Links. If you find a resource there you think we should be linking directly, please let us know!

Please be aware that many season-specific links you encounter will reference materials from the 2020-2021 season (rather than the current 2021-2022 season) until after the challenge release in August. We will update these links as soon as we can, as necessary.


## LEGO&reg; CON 2021

LEGO&reg; has announced the virtual LEGO&reg; CON 2021! This is the first LEGO&reg; CON EVER, and you can learn more about it [here](https://www.lego.com/en-us/lego-con). The event is scheduled for June 26, 2021 at Noon Eastern Daylight Time (11 AM Central Daylight Time).

Hello teams!

We know many of your schools have been disrupted lately, and we hope you are all doing well.


## Remote Qualifiers (Challenge Only)

We would like to thank everyone who was able to attend the webinar last week. There were some great questions, and we hope to take those conversations and improve the remote experience. For those unable to attend, you can view the webinar [at this link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ku6DdmQkHE8&t=1245s).

We have compiled [the notes](../remote-qualifiers.md) from the presentation. There are links to many of the critical documents, so make sure to read over them.

As a reminder, the qualifier fee is \$25 per team. This is payable to *FIRST*&reg; in Alabama, **not** *FIRST*&reg;, and can be paid by mail at

Here are a few (brief) takeaways:
- Your three robot round videos should be uploaded before the morning of your event and should follow the guidelines in the remote event document.
- Your live judging session will last 30 minutes via Zoom on the day of your event. Make sure to practice judging over Zoom and that your team can connect to a Zoom meeting, whether they are co-located or in separate locations.
- The awards ceremony for your event will be on the Sunday afternoon following your event.
- We will be sending the links each team needs by this Friday (January 21).

For more detailed information, make sure to check the notes from the webinar. If you have any questions, please let us know!


## Alabama Festival (Explore Only)

The Alabama Festival scheduled for April 9, 2022, at the von Braun Center in Huntsville is still planned in-person! Due to some additional planning needed for our remote Challenge events, though, we do not have registration information available just yet. We do hope to have it available by next week.

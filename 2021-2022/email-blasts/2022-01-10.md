Hello teams!

We hope your new year is off to a great start! We have some EXTREMELY important announcements to share.


## Remote Qualifiers (Challenge Only)

Due to recent trends, *FIRST*&reg; in Alabama has decided to limit in-person events previously planned for January and February. As a result, our qualifiers will now be **remote** events. Here's what that means for you:
- Teams will still compete in the events they are assigned to. Trophies, pins, advancement, judging, and robot rounds will all be done **by event**, just as if the events were in-person.
- The registration fee is **being reduced** to \$25. If you have already sent in your registration money, we will be working to get that sorted out as soon as we can.
- For your robot rounds, you will submit three (3) videos of your robot running a 2.5 minute match, **due on the morning of your event**. We will have additional guidance on what we expect by next Monday.
- For judging, we will be assigning a 30 minute time slot to each team **live, on the day of your event**. You will also be allowed to submit one, five slide PowerPoint with images and notes. We will send details by next Monday.
- We will have virtual award ceremonies on the **Sunday afternoon** (the next day) following your event.

At present, we anticipate an in-person state championship, but with the current trends we are concerned about being able to adequately staff our events while not contributing to the spread.

To answer questions and provide more details, we will be hosting a webinar on **Friday, January 14** at **6 PM**. We'll record the session, like we have the others. If you have questions you want addressed in the session but can't make it, please email them before Friday. To register for the webinar, please use [this link](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/remote-qualifier-webinar-tickets-243343746697).


## Alabama Festival (Explore Only)

The Alabama Festival scheduled for April 9, 2022, at the von Braun Center in Huntsville is still planned in-person! We should have registration information available by next week as we continue to sort out the upcoming Challenge Events.

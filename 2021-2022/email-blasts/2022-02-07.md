Hello teams!

We are ready for the next phase of the season!

## Remote Qualifiers and the Alabama Championship (Challenge)

We would like to congratulate all teams who participated in the Port City and HSV Qualifiers this past weekend! You can view the [results on this page](https://github.com/drewwhis/first-in-alabama/blob/main/2021-2022/challenge-results.md). We have also updated the results for the Southern Railway Qualifier to include advancing teams.

We are now opening the process for championship registration! If your team received an advancement, you **must** complete [this registration form](https://forms.gle/SBMSZZo258HyS1BA7) by **Monday, February 14**. We ask that all teams complete the form to indicate whether or not your team will attend. **Failure to fill out the form will result in forfeiting the spot**.

For teams who **did not advance**, we are opening a wait list to fill open spots. We're already aware of some teams unable to attend, so there are spots to fill! The wait list is open to all registered teams, including those who did not participate in a qualifier. Priority will be given to teams that **did compete** until that list is exhausted. Teams can fill out [this wait list registration](https://forms.gle/PeqiVvWa8VvJ5PjdA).

The Alabama Championship is scheduled for Saturday, March 5, 2022, at Fort Payne High School. We are still anticipating an in-person event, and the team registration fee is \$100. We will be sending invoices after initial registration closes on Monday. At this time, we would also like to remind all teams to make sure your team name is up-to-date in your *FIRST*&reg; Dashboard. We have instructions on our [FAQ page](https://github.com/drewwhis/first-in-alabama/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions).

Hello teams!

## Season Launch Date

We are excited to announce the Season Launch for CARGO CONNECT has been set. Tune in on August 17 at 12:00 PM EDT (that's 11:00 AM Central Daylight Time) to learn about the new season for your Challenge and Explore teams! Be on the lookout for informational materials to go out that day, too, including Robot Game Rules.

We will share the links here, in the Discord, and in the GitHub Wiki as soon as we have them available.


## DonorsChoose Funding Opportunity

There is a funding opportunity available for *FIRST*&reg; teams and Class Packs through DonorsChoose. This opportunity is open to any full-time educator or school district employee in the United States from a public or charter school, Head Start Center, or Bureau of Indian Education School who works directly with students at least 75 percent of the time.

BE AWARE: These funds **cannot** be used for team or Class Pack **registration**, but they can be used for kits and materials like the LEGO&reg; SPIKE Prime and WeDo 2.0 sets!

For more information, visit [this page](https://info.firstinspires.org/newscorp-donorschoose-school-engagement). The sooner you sign up, the sooner you may receive funding.


## Grant Locator Tool

To make it easier for teams to find grant opportunities, *FIRST*&reg; has launched a [Grant Locator Tool](https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/team-grants)! Using the tool, you are able to filter down a variety of criteria, including:
- What area is your team in (State, Country)?
- Are you a rookie or veteran team?
- What program (FRC, FTC, FLL Challenge, FLL Explore, Class Pack) are you involved with?

There are other links on the tool if you have questions. As of this writing, there is only an FTC grant opportunity available and one for Challenge teams in St. Charles County, Missouri, but the list will be updated as more are added, so check back frequently! If you become aware of a grant opportunity not in the list, please let us know so that we can see about getting it added.
